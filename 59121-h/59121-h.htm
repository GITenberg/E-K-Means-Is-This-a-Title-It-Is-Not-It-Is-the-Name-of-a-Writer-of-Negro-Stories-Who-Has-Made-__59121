<h2 id="Forword">Foreword.</h2>

<p>The stories in this volume were written simply
because of my interest in the stories themselves
and because of a whimsical fondness for the people
of that Race to whom God has given two supreme
gifts,&mdash;Music and Laughter.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the curious, I may say that
many of the incidents in these tales are true and
many of the characters and places mentioned
actually exist.</p>

<p>The Hen-Scratch saloon derived its name from
the fact that many of its colored habitués played
“craps” on the ground under the chinaberry
trees until the soil was marked by their scratching
finger-nails like a chicken-yard. The name Tickfall
is fictitious, but the locality will be easily
recognized by the true names of the negro settlements,
Dirty-Six, Hell’s-Half-Acre, Shiny, Tinrow,&mdash;lying
in the sand around that rich and
aristocratic little town like pigs around their dam
and drawing their sustenance therefrom.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts’s real name is Perique. Perique
is also the name of Louisiana’s famous homegrown
tobacco, and as Skeeter is too diminutive to
be named after a whole cigar, his white friends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
have always called him Butts. Vinegar Atts is a
well-known colored preacher of north Louisiana,
whose “swing-tail prancin’-albert coat” has been
seen in many pulpits, and whose “stove-pipe,
preachin’ hat” has been the target of many a stone
thrown from a mischievous white boy’s hand.
Hitch Diamond is known at every landing place
on the Mississippi River as “Big Sandy.”</p>

<p>When these tales were first published in the
<i>All Story Weekly</i>, many readers declared that
they were humorous. Nevertheless, I hold that
a story containing dialect must necessarily have
many depressing and melancholy features. But
dialect does not consist of perverted pronunciations
and phonetic orthography. True dialect is a
picture in cold type of the manifold peculiarities
of the mind and temperament. In its form, I have
attempted to give merely a <i>flavor</i> of the negro
dialect; but I have made a sincere attempt to
preserve the essence of dialect by making these
stories contain a true idea of the negro’s shrewd
observations, curious retorts, quaint comments,
humorous philosophy, and his unique point of
view on everything that comes to his attention.</p>

<p>The Folk Tales of Joel Chandler Harris are
imperishable pictures of plantation life in the
South before the Civil War and of the negro slave
who echoed all his master’s prejudice of caste and
pride of family in the old times that are no more.</p>

<p>The negroes of this volume are the sons of the
old slaves. Millions of them live to-day in the
small Southern villages, and as these stories indicate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
many changes of character, mind, and temperament
have taken place in the last half-century
through the modifications of freedom and
education.</p>

<p>This type also is passing. In a brief time, the
negro who lives in these pages will be a memory,
like Uncle Remus. “Ethiopia is stretching out
her hands” after art, science, literature, and
wealth, and when the sable sons of laughter and
song grasp these treasures, all that remains of
the Southern village negro of to-day will be a few
faint sketches in Fiction’s beautiful temple of
dreams.</p>

<h2 id="The_Late_Figger_Bush">The Late Figger Bush.</h2>

<p>Figger Bush did not look like a man who was
about to die; if anything, he looked like one who
ought to be killed.</p>

<p>He was a scarecrow sort of a negro, with ragged,
flapping clothes. His coal-black face formed a
background for a little, stubby, shoe-brush mustache,
and Figger thought that mustache justified
his existence in the world. He had not much
use for his coconut head except to support a
battered wool hat and grow a luxuriant crop of
kinky hair. He had an insuperable aversion to
all sorts of work.</p>

<p>None of these things indicated that Figger was
about to die; in fact, they showed that he was
enjoying life.</p>

<p>The only thing that indicated an unusual
condition in Figger was the fact that he was now
walking down the middle of the road with rapid
and ever-lengthening steps, glancing from side to
side, and grumbling aloud to himself.</p>

<p>“I gotta find dat Skeeter Butts an’ find him
quick,” he muttered. “Nothin’ like dis ain’t
never happen to me befo’, an’ nobody cain’t
’lucidate on my troubles like Skeeter kin.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>A high, cackling laugh, accompanied by a
hoarse bellow of laughter, floated to him upon
the hot August breeze, and Figger ceased his grumbling
and began to chuckle.</p>

<p>“I gits exputt advices now,” he mumbled.
“Skeeter am talkin’ sociable wid de Revun Vinegar
Atts.”</p>

<p>On top of the hill in front of the Shoofly church,
Figger found his two friends resting under the
shade of a chinaberry tree.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts, the little, yellow barkeeper
at the Hen-Scratch saloon, had the back of his
chair propped against the trunk of the tree, his
heels hung in the rungs of the chair in front, and
looked like a jockey mounted upon a bony, sway-backed
horse. Vinegar Atts, the fat, bald-headed,
moon-faced pastor of the Shoofly church, sat on
one chair, rested his feet on another, and had
his massive arms outspread upon the backs of
yet two other chairs. He looked like a pot-bellied
buzzard trying to fly upside down and
backward.</p>

<p>“Come up, Figger!” Vinegar howled, as he
kicked the chair, on which his feet rested, toward
him. “Take a seat, take a set-down, rest yo’ hat,
spit on de flo’&mdash;make yo’se’f at home!”</p>

<p>Figger picked up the chair, placed it back where
Atts could rest his feet upon it again, and sat down
upon the ground, interlocking the fingers of both
hands and nursing his bent knees.</p>

<p>“You been cuttin’ out chu’ch recent. How
come?” Vinegar bellowed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span></p>

<p>“Religium don’t he’p a po’ nigger like me,”
Figger responded gloomily.</p>

<p>“Dat’s a fack,” Atts agreed promptly. “Religium
is got to hab somepin to ketch holt on an’
you ain’t nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Whut ails you?” Skeeter inquired, looking
at Figger intently. “You ain’t look nachel to
me some way.”</p>

<p>Figger sighed deeply, then executed a feeble
grin.</p>

<p>“A nigger man is comin’ to see me, Skeeter,”
he explained, “an’ I don’t need him.”</p>

<p>“Who’s a-comin’?”</p>

<p>“Popsy Spout.”</p>

<p>“Whar’s he been at?” Vinegar asked.</p>

<p>“Yallerbam’,” Figger told him.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence while the two
waited for Figger to tell them all about it. But if
Figger ever did anything he had to be pushed
along.</p>

<p>“I don’t see nothin’ so powerful bad in dat,”
Skeeter snapped, impatient at the delay. “Popsy
Spout is comin’ from Yalabama&mdash;well?”</p>

<p>“It’s dis way,” Figger explained, slapping at
the ground with his battered wool hat to give
emphasis to his speech. “Popsy Spout is my
gran’pap on my mammy’s side. My mammy
died soon an’ Popsy raised me up. He always
toted a big hick’ry cane an’ he raised me pretty
frequent. One day he promise me a whalin’ an’
I snooped ten dollars outen his money-bag an’
skunt out fer Tickfall. Dat was twenty year ago.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>“You reckin’ Popsy is comin’ to colleck up?”
Skeeter snickered.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh. I figger dat Popsy is gittin’ ole
an’ lonesome an’ tuck up a notion to come an’
pay me a little visit.”</p>

<p>“How long will he stay on?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>“I kinder think he thinks he’ll stay on till he
dies,” Figger announced in tragic tones, as he produced
a soiled letter and held it out to Skeeter.
“Read dis, an’ see kin you find any yuther hopes
in whut he do say.”</p>

<p>Skeeter took the letter out of the envelope and
read it aloud, giving the peculiar African pronunciation
to the words as he spoke them:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Figger</span>:</p>

<p>Dis letter will kotch you jes’ befo’ I gits offen de
train at Tickfall. I wus raised an’ bawn in de Little
Mocassin Swamp, an’ I wants to come home an’ live
wid you till I die. I needs somebody of my kinnery
aroun’ so I won’t git so lonesome. Good-by. I’m
comin’ powerful soon.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Popsy Spout.</span>”<br />
</p>

<p>Skeeter handed the letter back with a look of
deep sympathy and pity.</p>

<p>“Bad luck, Figger,” Vinegar Atts bellowed.
“You cain’t mo’ dan half suppote yo’se’f, an’ now
you done got a ready-made gran’pap to suppote.
A nigger kin git mighty ole an’ deef, but he always
hears de dinner-horn.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Figger wailed. “Whut muss
I do?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p>“Don’t start squealin’ like a pig kotch in a gap,”
Skeeter snapped, as he passed around a box of
cigarettes. “Smoke one of dese an’ ease down
yo’ mind a little.”</p>

<p>“Whut muss I do?” Figger wailed again.</p>

<p>“Vinegar, you ax ’terrogations while I medjertates,”
Skeeter proposed, as he leaned his chair
back against the tree.</p>

<p>“When did you perceive dis here Popsy las’,
Figger?” Vinegar inquired.</p>

<p>“More’n twenty year ago.”</p>

<p>“Whut do he look like?”</p>

<p>“He looks like a black nigger. I s’pose he’s
bleached out some in de las’ twenty year.”</p>

<p>“Is you ever heard any word from him befo’?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh. Word ain’t been sont.”</p>

<p>“How do Popsy know you is still livin’?”
Vinegar inquired.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Skeeter Butts grunted, as he suddenly
sat up and slapped his hand upon his knee. “Dat’s
de very idear I needs!”</p>

<p>“Whut?” Vinegar asked.</p>

<p>“Figger Bush will be dead when Popsy comes,”
Skeeter snickered. “Dead an’ buried!”</p>

<p>“Not ef I kin he’p it!” Figger announced, as
he rose to his feet with a frightened air. “You
got to ketch a nigger fust befo’ you kin dead an’
bury him.”</p>

<p>“Set down, Figger!” Skeeter exclaimed. “Yo’
gran’pap on yo’ mammy’s side didn’t inherit you
no brains! Dis here is a good plan to git you out
of trouble.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>“Tell it to me slow,” Figger begged, as he resumed
his seat on the ground. “I don’t favor no
plan havin’ a dead Figger Bush in it.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Figger!” Skeeter urged. “I wants
you to pick out a nice-lookin’ nigger gal whut
could play like she wus yo’ widder.”</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Figger grinned, beginning to see the
light. “Scootie Tandy could play widder. She’s
been one about two year&mdash;all de nigger mens run
after her tryin’ to pussuade her to fergit her spite
an’ marry agin. I could git her to play widder.”</p>

<p>“Dat’ll put an eend to yo’ mis’ry,” Skeeter
cackled. “Go tell Scootie all yo’ trouble, ax
Scootie to meet de train dat Popsy comes on, an’
bust de sad news to him dat you is dead an’
buried!”</p>

<p>“Mebbe Popsy won’t b’lieve her,” Figger
objected.</p>

<p>“Me an’ Vinegar will back her up in dat tale,”
Skeeter assured him. “De revun elder won’t mind
stretchin’ de blanket a little fer de sake of savin’ a
friend. Ain’t dat so, Revun?”</p>

<p>“Dat’s so!” Vinegar declared. “My life job
an’ my callin’ is savin’ niggers!”</p>

<p>“Whar muss I git to while I’m bein’ dead?”
Figger inquired.</p>

<p>“Go fishin’,” Skeeter grinned. “Fishin’ is de
best spote on yearth fer de livin’ an’ de dead!”</p>

<p>“How long am I got to stay dead?” Figger
asked.</p>

<p>“When de ole man Popsy hears tell dat you is
gone hence an’ ain’t no mo,’ he’ll take his foot in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
his hand an’ ramble back to Yalabam’,” Vinegar
rumbled. “Dat’ll be yo’ sing to come fo’th from
de dead!”</p>

<p>Figger put on his battered hat and stood up.
He asked pleadingly:</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you loant a dead man half a dollar,
Skeeter?”</p>

<p>“Whut you want wid it?” Skeeter snapped.</p>

<p>“I figger dat a real live corp’ oughter git a hair-cut
an’ a shave!” Figger chuckled.</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Skeeter laughed, as he handed
out the money. “You scoot over an’ see Scootie
right now!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Scootie Tandy was a fat, good-natured young
woman, who wore red head-rags, wrapped up her
kinky hair with strings to give it a better kink,
and had no higher object in life than to be regular
at her meals.</p>

<p>She had worn deep mourning for over a year for
a worthless husband whose death had been advantageous
to her in that it gave her an excuse for
doing even less work than she had done when he
was living.</p>

<p>“It ’pears like I ain’t been well an’ strong sence
Jim died an’ lef’ me to ’tend to eve’ything,” she
whined at the kitchen doors of the white people,
to aid her plea for food and old clothes.</p>

<p>Figger believed he was in love with Scootie,
and Scootie made eyes at him, but Skeeter said they
were not thinking about marrying. He declared
they were merely watching each other to see which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
could live longest without work and without landing
in jail for vagrancy.</p>

<p>“Scootie,” Figger began, “you don’t mind
playin’ a widder, does you?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” Scootie told him. “Men is a heap
mo’ int’rusted in deir minds ’bout widders dan dey
is ’bout gals, pervidin’ ef de widders ain’t got no
nigger chillun crawlin’ on de cabin flo’.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind bein’ my widder?” Figger
inquired hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“I’d like it,” Scootie laughed. “Is you aimin’
to die real soon?”</p>

<p>“I passes off powerful soon,” Figger grinned.</p>

<p>Then Figger told her of his troubles, and explained
what he wanted her to do.</p>

<p>“My ole gran’pap won’t hab no easy job attachin’
hisse’f onto me,” Figger announced in
conclusion. “Dis here corp’ is gwine keep movin’
his remainders somewhar else.”</p>

<p>“Whut train is Popsy comin’ on?” Scootie
asked.</p>

<p>“He’ll be here on de dinner-time train, I think,”
Figger replied. “You go down an’ meet dat train,
an’ ef he comes you pass him back onto de caboose
an’ tell him to keep trabbelin’.”</p>

<p>“When muss I tell him you died?” Scootie
asked.</p>

<p>“Gwine on a year!” Figger suggested.</p>

<p>“Whut did you die of?”</p>

<p>“Two buckles on de lungs,” Figger told her.</p>

<p>“Wus you sick very long?” Scootie asked.</p>

<p>“Yes’m. Tell him I wus feelin’ feeble an’ not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
able to wuck none fer about fo’teen year, which
is how come I ain’t leave no property,” Figger
declared.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you got no picture of yo’se’f fer me to
set on de mantelpiece an’ cry at?” Scootie asked.</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Figger said, as he slipped his hand
into his coat-pocket and brought out a cheap
photograph. “Dis am de best koodak I’m ever
had took&mdash;it shows off my mustache so good!
Don’t dem lip-whiskers look nachel?”</p>

<p>“Dey shore do sot off yo’ face,” Scootie replied,
as she studied the photograph and considered all
the information Figger had given her. Finally
Scootie asked:</p>

<p>“S’pose Popsy don’t b’lieve all dese tales?”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no danger,” Figger answered. “I’ll
make myse’f absent, an’ Skeeter an’ Vinegar will
back you up.”</p>

<p>“All right, Figger,” Scootie grinned. “I’ll
gib you a lift-out. I don’t mind succulatin’
de repote dat you is dead; some folks will be dum
glad to hear it!”</p>

<p>“Bein’ dead ain’t such awful bad luck,” Figger
laughed. “I done promise de white folks to do
about fawty jobs of wuck, an’ dem whites keeps me
a dodgin’ like a bumpin’-bug. Furdermo’, I owes
a heap money in dis here town whut I don’t never
expeck to pay back, an’ my tongue gits dry tellin’
how soon I hopes to wuck an’ make some cash
money. Bless Gawd, dead niggers like me cain’t
wuck an’ cain’t pay&mdash;dey got to charge all my
debts to de dust an’ let de rain settle ’em!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>“My stomick tells me dat de dinner-time train
is mighty nigh here, Figger,” Scootie said. “You
better git away an’ let me dress up accawdin’ to
dis here sad succumstance.”</p>

<p>“Dis is whar I disappears complete, Scootie,”
Figger grinned, as he stepped off the porch. “I
hope you won’t slight yo’ mournin’ fer me atter
I’m gone.”</p>

<p>Then Scootie prepared herself to meet the
train&mdash;a black dress, black gloves, a long black
veil over a purple and yellow hat with a poll-parrot
on it, a palm-leaf fan, the edge appropriately
encircled with black braid, and a white
handkerchief with a broad border. She looked
at herself in the mirror and smiled with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I’s gwine wear mournin’ all my life,” she
announced to herself. “It makes my complexion
mo’ fair.”</p>

<p>When the train pulled into the station, Scootie
was standing near the negro coach, looking for a
man who resembled Figger’s description of Popsy
Spout as he remembered his grandfather after
twenty years. Only one negro passenger got off,
and Scootie merely glanced at him and waited for
some one else.</p>

<p>When the train pulled out, Scootie turned, and
the negro passenger was standing close beside her
on the platform.</p>

<p>“Is you lookin’ fer somebody?” Scootie asked.
“I knows eve’ybody in dis town.”</p>

<p>Then Scootie got a surprise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>“Yes’m,” the man answered, in a weak, tired
voice. “I wus expeckin’ Figger Bush.”</p>

<p>Scootie reeled back and glared at the speaker
with popping eyeballs.</p>

<p>He stood before her, over six feet tall and as
straight as an Indian. His face was as black as new
tar and was seamed by a thousand tiny wrinkles,
written all over with the literature of life and experience.
His long hair was as white as milk, and
his two wrinkled and withered hands rested upon
a patriarchal staff nearly as tall as himself.</p>

<p>On his head was a stove-pipe hat, bell-shaped,
the nap long since thrown off like an outworn
garment, and the top of the hat was as red as a
brick from exposure to the weather. An old, faded,
threadbare and patched Prince Albert coat swathed
his emaciated form like a bath-robe.</p>

<p>Instantly Scootie knew that this man belonged
to that vanishing race of negroes who were the
glory and the pride of the South in the ante-bellum
days. They cling like vines around the old homesteads,
cared for and protected by men who were
once their white masters, and when they die, more
white people attend their funerals than members
of their own race.</p>

<p>Only one thing denoted that age had left a
blight upon the dignified form of Popsy Spout,
and that mark was in his eyes: the vacant, age-dimmed
stare of second childhood, indicating that
reason no longer sat regnant upon the crystal
throne of the intellect, looking out of the windows
of the soul.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>“I’s powerful glad to meet a young gal like you,
honey,” he said in the high falsetto of old age.
“Figger is missed meetin’ me some way. He
always wus a mos’ onreliable piccaninny. I’s had
a long trip. My name is Popsy Spout.”</p>

<p>This was Scootie’s cue to turn on the water-works.
She brought out her black-bordered
handkerchief and began to weep.</p>

<p>“I wus lookin’ fer you, Popsy,” she sobbed.
“Poor Figger Bush is dead an’ I’s his widder!”</p>

<p>“How’s dat&mdash;which?” the old man quavered.</p>

<p>“Dead! Plum’ dead&mdash;dead an’ buried!”
Scootie wailed.</p>

<p>“Did he die layin’ down?” the old man asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. He died nachel.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” the old man snorted. “Dat suttinly
is strange. I never predick no sech come-out fer
Figger&mdash;how come de white folks didn’t shoot
him or hang him? He shore deeserved it!”</p>

<p>“Boo-hoo!” Scootie wailed.</p>

<p>“Aw, shut up!” the old man snapped, in high,
shrill tones. “Figger didn’t never amount to
nothin’ nohow. I know it’s all fer de best, an’ ef
you had de sense Gawd gibs to a crazy geese, you’d
be dum glad he’s a deader!”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so, suh,” Scootie mourned, “but I
shore miss him a-plenty.”</p>

<p>“Of co’se!” Popsy exploded. “You miss de
stomick-ache, too, but ’tain’t resomble to howl
because you ain’t got it. It’s proper to miss
pestications but ’tain’t good sense to mourn deir
loss. How long is Figger been dead?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p>“’Bout a year,” Scootie sobbed.</p>

<p>“By jacks!” Popsy snorted. “Been dead a
year an’ here you is all blacked up in mournin’
like a bucket of tar. Shut up! Whut you so
crazy ’bout a dead nigger fer?”</p>

<p>Thus importuned, Scootie saw that she was
wasting her tears on Figger as far as Popsy was
concerned.</p>

<p>“Whar is you gwine now?” Scootie inquired
in a voice which showed that she had found
comfort.</p>

<p>“I’s aimin’ to ooze along over to yo’ house
an’ git my dinner,” Popsy told her. “Which
way does we start?”</p>

<p>“Figger would shore be mighty sorry to miss
yo’ visit ef he wus alive an’ knowed about it,”
Scootie remarked as she led the way to her cabin.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so!” Popsy snapped, as he strode along
beside her, resting one hand upon her fat shoulder
and the other on his staff. “Dat nigger ain’t
never missed nothin’ but a good whalin’&mdash;I promised
him a lickin’ twenty year ago an’ he runned
away. He ain’t never come back.”</p>

<p>This speech had a sing-song swing to it, as if it
was a complaint which he had repeated for many
years whenever Figger’s name was mentioned.</p>

<p>“He ain’t never come back to git his wallupin’,”
the old man repeated.</p>

<p>Scootie snickered.</p>

<p>“Dat sounds right!” Popsy applauded, patting
the fat shoulder which supported one of his withered
hands. “’Tain’t no use to shed tears over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Figger. Livin’ or dead, he don’t deeserve nothin’
but a big bust-out laugh.”</p>

<p>“I’s glad you feels dat way about it, Popsy,”
Scootie chuckled. “You shore has cheered me
up some an’ eased my mind a-plenty.”</p>

<p>“You got any fryin’-size chickin at yo’ cabin?”
Popsy asked.</p>

<p>“Yep. I kin cook ’em so you’ll wanter die
wid a chicken bone in yo’ hand, too,” Scootie
told him. “An’ as fur my hot biskits&mdash;you’ll
want one of my hot biskits carved on yo’ tombstone!”</p>

<p>“Kin you affode to keep ice-water?”</p>

<p>“Yep. A driver on de ice-wagon is courtin’
me servigerous an’ he slips me a free chunk eve’y
day.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s good sense,” Popsy told her. “Is you
got any objections to my chawin’ all de eatin’
terbacker I wants to?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh,” Scootie giggled. “Figger chawed.”</p>

<p>“Does you maintain a jug?” Popsy wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“I does; an’ it’s passable full, too.”</p>

<p>“I bet it splashed pretty low when Figger wus
livin’,” Popsy bleated. “When I wus fotchin’
up dat piccaninny he jes’ nachelly graduated to’des
a jug like all de buzzards in de settlemint comin’
to a mule’s fun’ral!”</p>

<p>“Dar’s my cabin&mdash;over yon.” Scootie pointed.</p>

<p>The walk had wearied the old man, and it
required all of Scootie’s strength to lift him up
the steps to a rocking-chair upon the porch. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
brought him out a turkey-wing fan, a twist of
chewing-tobacco, and a pipe which had belonged
to her deceased husband. Then she thought of
Figger’s photograph, and she handed that to him.</p>

<p>But the aged man’s mind had suddenly gone
blank because of his physical weakness, exhausted
by his long walk.</p>

<p>“Whut you gimme dis here little card fer,
Scootie?” he asked perplexedly.</p>

<p>“Dat’s a picture of Figger, Popsy!” Scootie
exclaimed, turning it so he could see the face.</p>

<p>“Figger who?” Popsy inquired.</p>

<p>“Figger Bush, Popsy,” Scootie told him in a
patient tone. “Yo’ little Figger&mdash;my dead husbunt&mdash;don’t
you remember Figger!”</p>

<p>“Is dat so?” the old man asked in uncertain
tones. He held the card up and looked at the
photograph for a long time.</p>

<p>“Whut you think about him, Popsy?” Scootie
asked.</p>

<p>“Dat dead nigger’s face an’ head shore growed
strong on hair an’ whiskers,” Popsy quavered, as
he laid the photograph in the crown of his upturned
stove-pipe hat, “like a damp marsh&mdash;don’t
grow nothin’ but rank grass!”</p>

<p>“Dat was de way Figger wus,” Scootie laughed.
“His head wus shore kinder soft an’ oozy.”</p>

<p>“When is we gwine git our dinner, Scootie?”
the old man demanded.</p>

<p>“Right now!” Scootie told him.</p>

<p>“All right!” Popsy said, as he leaned back in
his chair. “You call me when she’s ready. Feed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
me chicken an’ hot biskits an’ ice-water&mdash;lemme
taper off wid a dram an’ a leetle nap&mdash;den I want
you to lead me to de bank whar Marse Tommy
Gaitskill stays at. Lawd! Lawd! I ain’t sot
my eyes on little Tommy fer fifty year!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At two o’clock that afternoon Scootie conducted
Popsy Spout through the door of the Tickfall
National Bank, down a corridor in the rear of the
big vault, and knocked upon a door which bore in
dainty gold lettering the word: “President.”</p>

<p>In response to a voice within she opened the
door and pushed Popsy Spout forward.</p>

<p>Colonel Tom Gaitskill sat beside a table in a
swivel chair, a tall, handsome man with the air of
a soldier, ruddy-faced, white-haired, genial, and
smiling. Gaitskill’s fine eyes took him in with a
photographic glance.</p>

<p>The old negro stood before him, immaculately
neat, though his garments were ragged and time-worn.
Dignity sat upon his aged form like virtue
upon a venerable Roman senator. Indeed, there
flashed through the banker’s mind the thought
that men like this one who stood before him might
have sat in the Carthaginian council of war and
planned the campaign which led young Hannibal
to the declivities of the Alps where his horde of
Africans hung like a storm-cloud while Imperial
Rome trembled with fear behind the protection
of her walls.</p>

<p>Then fifty years rolled backward like a scroll.</p>

<p>Gaitskill saw a blood-strewn battlefield torn with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
shot and shell; he saw clouds of smoke, black,
acrid, strangling to the throat, rolling over that
field as fogs blow in from the sea; he saw a tall,
young, black man emerge from such a pall of
smoke carrying a sixteen-year-old boy dressed in
the bloody uniform of a Confederate soldier.
The young soldier’s arms and legs dangled against
the negro’s giant form as he walked, stepping over
the slippery, shot-plowed ground. He saw the
negro stagger with his burden to an old sycamore
tree and lay the inanimate form upon the ground
at its roots, composing the limbs of the boy with
beautiful tenderness; then he saw the negro
straighten up and gather into his giant paws a
broken branch of a tree which two men could
hardly have handled.</p>

<p>Waving this limb at the creeping pall of smoke,
he screamed like a jungle beast, and whooped:
“You dam’ Yanks, keep away from dis little white
boy&mdash;you done him a-plenty&mdash;he’s dead!”</p>

<p>Gaitskill stood up and stepped forward. He
held out a strong white hand, clasping the palsied
brown paw of Popsy Spout. No white man ever
received a warmer greeting, a more cordial welcome
than this feeble black man, aged, worn, tottering
through the mazy dreamland of second childhood.</p>

<p>Unnoticed, Scootie Tandy walked to a window
and seated herself.</p>

<p>The two old men sat down beside the table and
Scootie listened for two hours to reminiscences
which went back over half a century. Frequently
Popsy Spout’s mind wandered, and Gaitskill gave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
him a gentle stimulant of liquor, as thoughtful of
the darky’s waning strength as a courtier would
be of the comfort of a king.</p>

<p>“How old are you now, Popsy?” Gaitskill
smiled, after they had talked of old times.</p>

<p>“I’s sebenty year old&mdash;gwine on a hundred.”</p>

<p>“Do you really expect to live that long?”
Gaitskill asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, ef de white folks takes good keer
of me,” Popsy answered.</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pocket and brought out a
bulky package, tied up with many pieces of many-colored
string.</p>

<p>“Dat’s my money, Marse Tommy. Please unwrop
it an’ count it out loud fer me.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill poured the currency and coins upon
the table and with a money-handler’s expert ease,
he counted it aloud, announcing the total in about
a minute:</p>

<p>“One thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>Scootie Tandy gasped like a woman who had
been under water for about five minutes and had
just come up, but neither of the men noticed her.</p>

<p>Popsy Spout hesitated a minute, scratched
his snow-white hair, and looked at the neat piles
of money with an air of perplexity.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that correct?” Gaitskill asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s c’reck,” Popsy said uncertainly.
“Dat’s de same number I got when I counted
it, but somepin is powerful strange ’bout dat
money.”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” Gaitskill asked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>“You counted it so quick, Marse Tommy!”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I counted it right, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, but&mdash;I reckin’ it’s all right, Marse
Tommy. But, you see, it tuck me five whole
days to count dat money an’ it wus de hardest
wuck I ever done&mdash;I sweated barrels of sweat!
It ’peared like a whole big pile, when I counted
it. But ef I spends it as quick as you counted it,
’twon’t las’ me till I kin walk outen dis here bank!”</p>

<p>“I understand,” Gaitskill smiled. “But you
don’t want to spend this money. How long did
it take you to accumulate it?”</p>

<p>“Fawty year,” Popsy told him. “Bad times
comes frequent to a nigger, an’ I wanted to save
a leetle ahead.”</p>

<p>“The idea is to take as long spending it as you
did accumulating it,” Gaitskill said. “In that
case, it will last you until you have passed one
hundred.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s de properest way to do,”
Popsy agreed. “Dat’s why I fotch dis money to
you. Kin you keep it fer me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. That’s what this bank is for.”</p>

<p>“Marse Jimmy Gaitskill over in Burningham&mdash;his
bank paid me int’rust prannum on dat money,”
Popsy said.</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you interest per annum, too,” Gaitskill
smiled, well knowing that his brother had
supported Popsy Spout for half a century. “How
much money will you need to live on each year?”</p>

<p>“I kin git along on ’bout ten dollars a month,
Marse Tommy&mdash;wid de clothes an’ vittles dat de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
white folks gimme. I kin save a little out of dat
to ’posit back in de bank fer rainy days.”</p>

<p>“That’s one hundred and twenty dollars a year
with clothes and food,” Gaitskill laughed. “Some
of the bank’s patrons would like to get that much
interest per annum.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. Marse Jimmy Gaitskill specified
dat my nigger money drawed powerful int’rust
outen his bank.”</p>

<p>“You can come here and draw ten dollars every
month,” Gaitskill said, and he picked up a card
and wrote a few words upon it.</p>

<p>“Dat’ll fix me fine, Marse Tommy. I kin live
scrumpshus on dat.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going to live?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got nowhar yit,” Popsy said.</p>

<p>“Would you like to live in the log cabin where
you lived fifty-five years ago?” Gaitskill inquired.</p>

<p>“Whar I married at? Whar me an’ Ca’lline
live happy till all us boys went off to de war?
Whar you an’ me an’ Marse Jimmy an’ little Hinry
useter roast goobers in de hot ash?” Popsy asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“The very same,” Gaitskill answered softly.
“With the big pecan tree still standing before it,
and the big stone door-step where we boys cracked
the nuts.”</p>

<p>Popsy Spout rose to his feet and bowed like
some aged patriarch standing in the presence of
a king. His high, quavering voice sobbed like
the wailing of a child:</p>

<p>“Marse Tommy, de Gaitskill fambly is de top
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
of de heap fer kindness an’ goodness to dis pore ole
nigger!”</p>

<p>He sank back into his chair, wiping the tears
from his eyes.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” Gaitskill said, and his voice was
so soft that each word was like a caress. “We all
remember Henry.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s so, suh,” Popsy said, suddenly straightening
his bent and quivering shoulders. “Marse
Jimmy is told me frequent ’bout you an’ him gwine
up dar an’ findin’ Hinry under dat sycamo’ tree
whar I buried him at. I’s glad you fotch him
back home an’ buried him wid his own folks.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll walk out to his grave together some
day,” Gaitskill murmured.</p>

<p>He rose and walked to the window. He looked
out for a moment, then turned and handed Popsy
the card on which he had written a few minutes
before.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you often, Popsy,” he said. “Your
old cabin is still at the foot of the hill by the old
spring. It’s unoccupied&mdash;move in as soon as
you please.”</p>

<p>“Whut is dis, Marse Tommy?” Popsy asked,
as he looked curiously at the folded paper.</p>

<p>“It’s an order on my store for food,” Gaitskill
said. “You can draw some groceries every Saturday
night. That’s part of the interest per annum,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Bless Gawd!” Popsy Spout quacked. “Ten
dollars a month wages an’ reg’lar rations eve’y
Saddy night! You shore is a noble white man,

Marse Tommy! Come on, Scootie. Us’ll git
gwine befo’ we gits happy an’ gits to shoutin’ an’
bust up all de furnisher in dis white man’s bank!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“My Lawd, Figger Bush!” Skeeter Butts
exclaimed, as his friend entered the Hen-Scratch
saloon. “You look like a skint mule.”</p>

<p>“I done disguised myse’f!” Figger grinned as
he took off his battered wool hat.</p>

<p>Figger’s famous shoe-brush mustache was gone,
and his head was shaved until it was as smooth
and slick as a black piano key.</p>

<p>“Whut you did yo’se’f so funny fer?” Skeeter
demanded, as Figger smiled and revealed a row of
teeth like new tombstones.</p>

<p>“I decided to stay in town an’ be a corp’,”
Figger explained, “so I had myse’f fixed up so dat
not even my widder would know me.”</p>

<p>“Is you seed Popsy yit?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>“Yep. I hid behime de cornder of de deppo
when de train trundled in, an’ Popsy dismounted
off. Scootie cried an’ tuck on consid’able, an’ I
wus plum’ satisfied wid de results.”</p>

<p>“Did Popsy ’pear much broke up?” Skeeter
inquired.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t tell ’bout dat,” Figger chuckled.
“Scootie tuck him to her cabin fer dinner an’ I
seed ’em walkin’ aroun’ town&mdash;I s’pose dey is
huntin’ fer my grave.”</p>

<p>“How do bein’ a corp’ feel like&mdash;so fur?”
Skeeter snickered.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so bad,” Figger remarked. “It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
mought be better ef de town would take a notion
to gib me a fust-class fun’ral. Of co’se, de Tickfall
quawtette would hab to sing, an’ I’s de male serpranner
in dat quawtette. It would be a real nice
somepin new fer a corp’ to sing at his own fun’ral.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe us could git de Nights of Darkness to
hold a lodge of sorrer on you,” Skeeter cackled.</p>

<p>“Ef dey does, I wants to sing my new solo
’bout ‘Locked in de stable wid de sheep,’” Figger
announced.</p>

<p>“Whut about de death ben’fit?” Skeeter
inquired. “Is you gwine apply fer dat?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” Figger laughed. “Ef de cormittee
’vestigates an’ repotes me dead, dey kin gib dat
ben’fit to Popsy.”</p>

<p>At this point the green-baize doors of the saloon
were pushed open and Scootie Tandy blew in
quivering with excitement.</p>

<p>“Whut’s up, Scootie?” Skeeter exclaimed,
springing to his feet.</p>

<p>“Gawd pity you, Figger!” Scootie howled in
tragic tones. “You made a awful mistake in
gwine dead so suddent!”</p>

<p>“Which way?” Figger asked in a frightened
voice.</p>

<p>“I went to de bank wid Popsy Spout an’ found
out dat Popsy an’ Marse Tom Gaitskill is kinnery!”
Scootie gushed forth.</p>

<p>“Hear dat, now!” Skeeter exclaimed in a voice
of wonder.</p>

<p>“Popsy gib Marse Tom a wad of money dat it
took Popsy five days to count!” Scootie ranted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>“Oh, my <i>Lawd</i>!” Figger wailed.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom gib Popsy one hundred an’ twenty
dollars int’rust prannum on his money, an’ a
awder on de sto’-house fer reg’lar rations, an’ a
cabin to live in!” Scootie squalled.</p>

<p>“My gawsh!” Figger bleated in dismay. “I
done busted a egg on my own doorstep an’ hoodooed
my own se’f!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s whut you done, Figger!” Scootie howled.
“I tole Popsy real prompt dat he needed a nuss an’
housekeeper in his ole age, an’ as Figger’s widder
I wus lawfully ’lected to dat job, an’ he tuck me
up right now!”</p>

<p>“Oh-huh!” Figger grunted in despair.</p>

<p>“Me an’ Popsy is gwine move in de ole log hut
behime Marse Tom’s house to-morrer,” Scootie
exulted. “Ten dollars per month an’ reg’lar
vittles, chicken an’ pie&mdash;I won’t never hab to
wuck no more.”</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy!” Figger sighed.</p>

<p>“Good-by, niggers!” Scootie exclaimed in a
happy voice. “I won’t never reckernize you-alls
no mo’&mdash;I draws a pension!”</p>

<p>She swept out of the house and left two men
struck speechless by the information she brought.</p>

<p>A moment later they were interrupted again.
Vinegar Atts plowed through the swinging doors,
puffing like a steam-boat and sweating like an
ice-pitcher.</p>

<p>“Whar kin I find Brudder Popsy Spout,
Skeeter?” he bellowed. “I wants to ’vite him to
jine de Shoofly chu’ch an’ set heavy in de amen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
cornder. Dat’s de biggest nigger whut ever come
to dis town. Word is sont out dat he old-soldiered
wid de Gaitskills&mdash;fit wid de white folks! I needs
him in my chu’ch!”</p>

<p>Neither Skeeter nor Figger made a reply. Their
air of tragedy silenced Vinegar Atts, and he crept
forward on tiptoe to where the two men were sitting,
smoking cigarettes and sighing. When Vinegar
reached a point, where he could see the face of
Figger Bush, he jumped as if he had seen a
ghost.</p>

<p>“My&mdash;good&mdash;<i>gosh</i>, Figger!” Vinegar wailed
in his siren-whistle voice. “You done suicided
yo’se’f! Took five days to count his money&mdash;got
it in de bank fetchin’ int’rust&mdash;livin’ in his
own cabin an’ drawin’ rations&mdash;an’ you is de only
blood kin of Tickfall’s leadin’ nigger sitson an’
you&mdash;is&mdash;dead!”</p>

<p>“Tell me whut to do, Revun?” Figger wailed.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got time, Figger!” Atts bawled.
“I got to tote a Christyum greetin’ an’ welcome to
dat noble nigger man!”</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts went out of the saloon with the
rolling walk of a big bear.</p>

<p>“Tell me whut to do, Skeeter!” Figger wailed.</p>

<p>“Search me!” Skeeter exclaimed. “’Tain’t
no trouble fer a nigger to die&mdash;dat comes nachel.
But when a nigger tries to come to life an’ make
folks b’lieve it&mdash;Lawdy!”</p>

<p>“I’s gwine right down an’ see Popsy!” Figger
announced with sudden determination. “I’ll tell
him dat Scootie is been lyin’ to him all de time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
I kin prove by Marse Tom an’ all de white folks
dat I ain’t never been dead a-tall!”</p>

<p>“I hopes you luck, Figger!” Skeeter exclaimed
in a tone which indicated that he considered such
an enterprise futile.</p>

<p>Figger lost no time in getting to the cabin where
Scootie lived.</p>

<p>He found Popsy sitting upon the porch, smoking
a corn-cob pipe which had been the property of
Scootie’s deceased husband, and languidly slapping
at his face with a turkey-wing fan. His stove-pipe
hat rested upon the floor at his feet and contained
a big red handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Popsy!” Figger greeted him cordially,
holding out his hand. “Don’t you reckomember
me?”</p>

<p>The old man removed his pipe from his mouth,
rested his turkey-wing fan upon his lap, reached
for his long patriarchal staff as if he were about to
rise; then he leaned back in his chair and surveyed
Figger a long time.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, I ain’t never seed yo’ favor befo’,”
he quavered.</p>

<p>“I’s little Figger,” Figger informed him ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>“Little Figger is dead,” Popsy answered, looking
at Bush with faded eyes, in which the light of
doubt and suspicion and a little fear was growing.
“I lives wid little Figger’s widder.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a mistake, Popsy,” Figger protested.
“I ain’t died yit. Scootie’s been lyin’ to you
’bout me.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>The old man leaned over and fumbled in the
crown of his stove-pipe hat. He brought out his
big red handkerchief, and slowly unwrapped the
photograph which Scootie had given him when he
first entered her home, a photograph of a negro
with a woolly head and a shoe-brush mustache.
Handing this to Figger, he asked sharply:</p>

<p>“Does you look like dat nigger in dat photygrapht?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh,” Figger replied with evident
reluctance.</p>

<p>“Dat’s de little Figger Bush I mourns,” Popsy
said. “Dat’s Scootie’s dead husbunt. You ain’t
look like him a bit&mdash;you look like a picked geese!”</p>

<p>“I’s de very same man, Popsy!” Figger wailed
in desperation. “Only but I done had my hair
an’ mustache cut off.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it!” Popsy declared in positive
tones. “I raised dis here Figger Bush, an’ I
knows he never earnt enough money in his dum
lazy life to commit a shave an’ a hair-cut!”</p>

<p>“O Lawdy, whut muss I do?” Figger wailed.</p>

<p>“Git away from dis cabin an’ don’t never show
yo’se’f here no mo’!” the old man howled. “I
wouldn’t b’lieve you wus Figger Bush ef you
sweared on de Bible an’ all de twelve opossums!”</p>

<p>Popsy pounded upon the floor of the porch
with the end of his long staff.</p>

<p>“O Scootie!” he called. “Git outen dat kitchen
an’ come here a minute.”</p>

<p>Hope flamed up in the heart of Figger. He
knew that no one could convince Popsy that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
was not dead more certainly than the woman who
pretended to be his widow.</p>

<p>Scootie came out upon the porch and gazed
with popping eyes at Figger Bush.</p>

<p>“Is dis here nigger yo’ dead husbunt?” Popsy
snapped, pointing a palsied finger at Figger.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh,” Scootie replied truthfully.</p>

<p>The old man stood up. He caught his long
staff at the little end as a man grasps a baseball
bat. He balanced it a moment, poising himself
on his feet, as if he were getting ready to knock a
“homer,” aiming the stick at Figger’s round, ball-like
head!</p>

<p>“<i>Git out!</i>” Popsy whooped.</p>

<p>Figger got out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Early the next morning Scootie sent two wagonloads
of household goods to the log cabin in the
rear of Colonel Tom Gaitskill’s home, where
Popsy had taken his young wife fifty-five years
before.</p>

<p>Scootie deposited these goods in the two front
rooms, fixing them up so that Popsy would have
a comfortable place after his arrival, and while she
was arranging the rest of the rooms. In one room
she placed a rickety sofa, a couple of chairs, and a
table. She hung a few pictures on the wall, placed
a few ornaments upon the mantelpiece, and from
the spring beside the house she brought a pitcher
of water, placed it on the table, and set a drinking
glass beside it.</p>

<p>In the other room she set up Popsy’s bed, placed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
beside it the only comfortable rocking-chair she
possessed, put Popsy’s old, battered suit-case,
which contained all his worldly goods, under the
bed, and placed upon the mantelpiece all the
tobacco and pipes which her late husband had
left her.</p>

<p>Then she returned to her own cabin to superintend
the removal of the remainder of her goods.</p>

<p>As she came into the yard, Popsy called to her
from his seat on the porch.</p>

<p>“I ain’t no good settin’ here in dis rockin’-chair,
Scootie. I’ll be gittin’ along to’des my
own cabin!”</p>

<p>“Don’t go yit, Popsy,” Scootie begged. “Wait
till de nex’ wagon comes. I’ll set de rockin’-chair
up in de wagon an’ let you ride to yo’ cabin wid
de load!”</p>

<p>“I ain’t gwine do it!” the old man shouted
irascibly. “I ain’t gwine be kotch settin’ up in
a rockin’-chair in a wagon like a ole nigger woman
ridin’ to a all-day nigger fun’ral wid dinner on de
grounds. I’ll walk an’ tote my own carcass to dat
cabin, like a man!”</p>

<p>“Ef pore Figger wus livin’, I’d git him to hitch
up de kerridge an’ drive you to de cabin,” Scootie
said mischievously.</p>

<p>“Huh!” the old man shouted. “Figger wouldn’t
hab sense enough to find my ole cabin. When de
good Lawd passed aroun’ brains, Figger had his
head in a woodpecker’s hole lookin’ fer aigs!”</p>

<p>Muttering to himself in sheer perversity, he
pranced down the road for a hundred yards or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
so, then, out of sight of Scootie, he settled down
to a sedate and dignified walk. In a little while
he began to use his long staff, leaning heavily
upon it as he climbed the long hill which led to
the Gaitskill home.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill he passed a negro sitting
disconsolately upon the end of a log. He was a
scarecrow sort of a negro, with ragged, flapping
clothes; a close observer might have noticed that
he had recently worn a stubby, shoe-brush mustache;
his head was shaved as smooth and slick
as a black piano-key.</p>

<p>“Good mawnin’,” Popsy Spout quavered.</p>

<p>“Mawnin’, Popsy,” Figger murmured in a
tragic tone&mdash;a voice from the tomb, a greeting
from the dead!</p>

<p>The old man walked on, his step feebler now,
his staff serving him more and more, his progress
slower.</p>

<p>The August sun shone with scorching heat,
the sunlight spraying from the leaves of the trees
like water; the August breeze was like a breath
from the open furnace-doors where iron is melted
and flows like water; the sand of the highway
was like embers scorching the feet. The old man
staggered on, muttering to himself.</p>

<p>Figger Bush arose slinkingly and walked behind
Popsy at a respectful distance, like a dog which
had been whipped and told not to follow. He kept
close to the high weeds and the bushes which
grew beside the road, so that he could hide promptly
if Popsy turned and looked back.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>But Popsy did not look back. His age-dimmed
eyes were set upon a big white house with large
colonial columns which stood upon the top of the
hill. Half a century had passed since he had seen
this home last, and eagerness overcame his physical
weakness and carried him to the hilltop where the
beautiful lawn lay like a green carpet spread before
the door.</p>

<p>Popsy leaned weakly upon the gate and gazed
long and earnestly at the stately old home. He
assumed the attitude of one who was listening for
some familiar sound, and was perplexed because
he could hear nothing.</p>

<p>Alas! Popsy was listening for footsteps that
were silent and for voices which for fifty years
had not been music in the porches of the ear! For
a moment the old man had forgotten the years
which had passed since last he saw this house,
and he was listening for the voices of a young
bride’s father and mother, and for the laughter
and shouting of three Gaitskill boys&mdash;Tom, Jim,
Henry!</p>

<p>“I bound dem boys is huntin’ squorls over in de
swamp, or mebbe dey’s monkeyin’ aroun’ dat
wash-hole,” the old man murmured doubtfully.
“Dat house shore do ’pear powerful still ’thout
dem noisy, aggervatin’ bullies bellerin’ to each
yuther.”</p>

<p>Popsy fumbled feebly through his pockets and
brought his hands out empty.</p>

<p>“Dem dum boys is mighty stingy wid deir
chawin’ terbacker,” he mumbled in an irritated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
tone. “Dey don’t gimme half enough to keep me
runnin’! Sence Tom hitched up wid dat pretty
Mis’ Mildred, he done lef’ off chawin’, an dat cuts
down my ’lowance. Nev’ mind! I knows whar
dem dum boys keep deir chawin’, an’ I’ll ’vent some
excuse to go to de house an’ I’ll holp myse’f liberal.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Popsy Spout remembered certain
boyish pranks which Tom and Jim and Henry
had played upon him fifty years before. He dimly
recalled finding his tables and chairs hanging
from the limbs of trees, his bed carried over in the
cow-pasture and placed in the middle of the field,
his few cooking pots crowning the tops of fence-posts
around his cabin!</p>

<p>“Hod zickety!” he exclaimed. “I bound dem
rapscallions is pesticatin’ my Ca’lline plum’ to
death!”</p>

<p>He turned away from the gate and hurried as
rapidly as his feeble legs would carry him down the
road.</p>

<p>When at last he reached the cabin, he sat down
upon the big stone step completely exhausted.</p>

<p>A big pecan tree stood in front of the house,
its wide-spreading branches completely shading
the front yard. Under this tree three of Popsy’s
piccaninnies had romped, and countless generations
of hound puppies had rolled in the dust, and
scratched in the sand at its roots.</p>

<p>To Popsy’s left was the big stone spring-house,
the roof entirely gone, and leaves and branches
had blown into the four walls and choked the
stream which flowed from the hillside.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>“I been aimin’ to fix dat roof,” Popsy murmured.
“It ’pears like I cain’t hardly find time to do nothin’,
I got to wuck fer de white folks so hard.”</p>

<p>He turned and looked behind him.</p>

<p>Two doors opened out upon the front porch,
and the two rooms visible to him were furnished.
Having seen the furniture in Scootie’s cabin, he
recognized it now, and thought it was the furniture
of his old home fifty years before.</p>

<p>Then one of the bizarre conceits of second childhood
knocked upon the crumbling portals of his
brain and found admittance. He thought that
he was a young man again, and that the buxom
negro girl whom he had married in the presence
of the white folks up yonder on the hill in the
drawing-room of the Gaitskill home, was still alive,
and occupied this cabin with him.</p>

<p>“Ca’lline! Ca’lline!” he called sharply.</p>

<p>But Caroline, sleeping in her narrow, silent
chamber under a scrub-oak tree on a hillside
in Alabama, made no answer.</p>

<p>“Ca’lline!” he called again, in a voice which
he tried to make loud, but which failed through
weakness. “Ca’lline! Cain’t you hear me callin’
you?”</p>

<p>The old man stood up in perplexity. His
fuddled brain could not grasp the reason for this
silence and loneliness. He climbed feebly, with
the aid of his staff, up the stone steps, and pounded
loudly upon the crumbling floor of the porch.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ca’lline! Whar in dumnation is you
gone at?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>He entered the room where Scootie had prepared
his bed with the idea that he might want to lie
down and rest after his trip to the cabin, and he
took his seat in the comfortable rocking-chair,
placing his stove-pipe hat beside him on the floor.</p>

<p>“Ca’lline!” he wailed. There was no answer
to his call.</p>

<p>The fire of exasperation flamed in the ancient
man’s withered frame, and he manifested his
annoyance by kicking his beloved stove-pipe hat
across the room.</p>

<p>“Dag-gone de dag-gone day whut fotch me de
dag-gone luck of totin’ dat dag-gone fat nigger
gal to my cabin!” he wailed. “<i>Ca’lline!</i> Whar in
dumnation is you an’ dem three nigger brats?”</p>

<p>He leaned back, resting his shaking, palsied
head wearily against the chair.</p>

<p>“Dem chillun take atter deir maw,” he commented.
“Dey’s gad-arounders!”</p>

<p>From the top of the big pecan tree a mocking-bird
broke forth in delirious music. The loud,
clear notes, imitating every bird which roamed the
woods, echoed back from the woods and the hillside,
and broke in jewels of melody around the old
log cabin.</p>

<p>The old man listened, sighed gratefully, and
smiled.</p>

<p>“Dat’s one of dem wuthless, no ’count piccaninnies
a-comin’ now,” he muttered. “Dem chillun
got deir whistlin’ gift from deir paw. I could
whistle jes’ like dat befo’ I loss all de toofs outen
my head.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>Instantly a footstep sounded in the rear of the
house, and the door opened. Figger Bush entered
the room and stopped near the door, looking at
Popsy Spout with eyes as wistful as the eyes of
a hound.</p>

<p>“Whar de debbil is you been at, Figger?”
the old man howled. “I been callin’ you all de
mawnin’!”</p>

<p>“I been settin’ aroun’,” Figger muttered. “I’s
tired!”</p>

<p>“By dam’!” the old man snorted. “Mebbe
yo’ legs is a little feeble an’ tired, but yo’ stomick
don’t never weary none. Whut you been doin’
in dat kitchen&mdash;eatin’ or drinkin’?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” Figger mumbled.</p>

<p>“Ef you been drinkin’ dat dram agin, I’ll find
out about it!” Popsy ranted in the falsetto of
senility. “Licker talks mighty loud when it gits
loose from de jug, an’ de fust time you whoops a
yell I’ll wallop yo’ hide wid dis stick.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Figger murmured, rubbing his
shaved head.</p>

<p>“Whar is yo’ hair gone at?” Popsy howled,
glaring at Figger’s bald pate.</p>

<p>“Ole Mis’ Mildred cut it off!” Figger prevaricated
with a snicker. “She say she wanted
to sot a hin an’ needed my wool to make a nest.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” the old man snorted in disgust. “It’s
a pity she didn’t take one of dese here wooden
teethpicks an’ beat yo’ brains out while she wus
at it!”</p>

<p>Figger turned and started to go out.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>“Hey, Figger!” Popsy squalled.</p>

<p>“Whut?” Figger asked.</p>

<p>“You stay aroun’ dis cabin so you kin wait on
me!”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Figger grinned.</p>

<p>“Ef you leave dis house ’thout axin’ my say-so,
I’ll skin you alive!”</p>

<p>“I ain’t gwine leave you, Popsy,” Figger
assured him. “Nobody cain’t git me away from
dis cabin widout compellment!”</p>

<p>The mocking-bird in the top of the pecan tree
started again its song of delirious music.</p>

<p>“Go out an’ tell dat brat to stop dat whistlin’
so I kin take me a nap!” Popsy commanded, as
his weary head rested upon the back of the chair
and he closed his age-dimmed eyes.</p>

<p>Figger stooped and picked up Popsy’s big red
handkerchief and passed out. He sat down upon
the steps of the porch and unwrapped from the
kerchief a cheap photograph of a man with a shoe-brush
mustache and a woolly, kinky head. He
gazed upon the picture for a long time, then tore it
into tiny bits and tossed the fragments over in the
high grass.</p>

<p>“Dat kind of Figger Bush is dead!” he announced
to himself, while in his eyes there glowed
the light of a great resolution. “I’s related to
Popsy by bornation, an’ me an’ Popsy is kinnery
of de Gaitskills by fightin’ wid de white folks
endurin’ of de war. Us is all quality niggers,
an’ we got to ack like we wus white!”</p>

<p>On top of the hill Figger heard the rumbling of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
two wagons, bringing the last of Scootie’s household
goods to her new home.</p>

<p>“Won’t de widder be supprised!” Figger
chuckled. “Bless Gawd! I ain’t as dead as
she an’ me thought I wus!”</p>

<p>He sat chuckling to himself until he recalled
Popsy’s last command, and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“He tole me not to let nothin’ disturb his nap!”
he muttered, as he walked rapidly up the hill
toward the wagons. “Now I’s gwine gib de widder
de wust jolt she ever got in her life!”</p>

<p>He hid behind a large tree until the first wagon
came to where he was standing. Scootie was
driving, and she looked like one who had suddenly
come into possession of a great treasure.</p>

<p>“Hol’ on a minute, Scootie!” Figger exclaimed,
stepping from behind the tree. “Popsy sont me
up here to tell you not to disturb him till he tuck
a leetle nap!”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so!” Scootie snapped. “Popsy don’t
know yo’ favor or yo’ face!”</p>

<p>But as she looked at Figger Bush she knew
beyond a doubt that he was installed in his grandfather’s
cabin. Figger’s face glowed with a light of
happiness and peace, and there was even something
in the face which held the promise of a new manhood
through the influence of the grand old man
who now lay asleep in the cabin.</p>

<p>Scootie began to weep.</p>

<p>“I reckin I’ll hab to take my furnicher an’
move out, Figger,” she sobbed. “I kinder hoped
I could live wid Popsy an’ take keer of him, an’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
make him happy in his ole age&mdash;but all dat wus
too much luck fer Scootie!”</p>

<p>“’Twouldn’t be mo’ dan you deserve, Scootie,”
Figger said in a pleading tone. “An’ I b’lieve
you an me could fix it up so dat it wouldn’t be
onpossible!”</p>

<p>“How?” Scootie asked.</p>

<p>“Leave dem mules standin’ here in de shade,
go wid me to de cotehouse an’ git some weddin’
licenses, an’ git Vinegar Atts to marrify us!”
Figger suggested.</p>

<p>Scootie promptly hit the ground with both feet,
landing by the side of Figger Bush.</p>

<p>“Come on, honey!” she said, seizing him by the
hand. “Less go quick!”</p>

<p>“Kin I go, too?” Little Bit, the driver of the
second wagon asked in a whining tone. No answer
was given to him, so he jumped down and followed.</p>

<p>From the top of the hill, they looked down to
where the red brick court-house baked in the summer
sun. Side by side they started toward the
court-house, and the new life.</p>

<p>On the other side of the hill, sole guardian of
the grand old man in the cabin, the mocking-bird
sat in the pecan tree and sang its song of love.

<h2 id="Hoodoo_Eyes">Hoodoo Eyes.</h2>

<p>The swinging doors of the Hen-Scratch saloon
fell apart and Conko Mukes walked in.</p>

<p>He was a large man and, to look at, very impressive.</p>

<p>The negroes in Tickfall had never seen clothes
like his, so large in stripe and so variegated in
color. On either lapel of his coat was a large,
brassy emblem of some secret lodge.</p>

<p>On the middle finger of each hand was a
rolled-gold band ring nearly an inch wide. Across
the vast expanse of his sky-muckle-dun-colored
waistcoat was a gangrened near-gold watch-chain
like the cable chain of a Mississippi River steamboat,
and a charm suspended from it was constructed
of the talons of an eagle.</p>

<p>His ponderous feet shook the floor as he walked
across the saloon and seated himself at a table.
Removing his stove-pipe hat, he placed that upon
one chair, kicked another chair from under the
table on which to deposit his feet, and leaned back
in a third chair, with his gorilla-like arms resting
comfortably across the back of a fourth. The
barroom appeared to be empty.</p>

<p>“Hey, dar! Come here&mdash;eve’ybody!” he bellowed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>Skeeter Butts peeped at Conko Mukes around
the corner of the bar behind which he was sitting.</p>

<p>The black face which he beheld advertised
unmistakably what Conko Mukes was. It was
the mug of a typical prize-fighter.</p>

<p>The face was clean-shaven, accentuating a
jaw, heavy, brutal, aggressive. His head was
also shaven, and every bump on his villainous
cranium stood forth like a promontory on a level
plain. His eyes were heavy-lidded, lazy, sleepy-looking,
like the eyes of a lion.</p>

<p>The nose had been broken and was crooked;
his thick lips had been battered in many fights
until they were shapeless, and the mouth was
simply an ugly gash across his face. And to
complete the adornment, one ear was “tin” and
the other was cauliflower, both permanently
disfigured and disfiguring.</p>

<p>Conko Mukes moved in his chair as if burdened
by the heavy weight of his muscles, and his heavy-lidded
eyes glowed yellow in the dim light of the
saloon as he glared around him. Again his voice
boomed:</p>

<p>“Hey! Am eve’ybody done hauled off an’
died? Come out here, Skeeter Butts&mdash;whut’s
hidin’ you?”</p>

<p>“I guess dis is my move-up,” Skeeter remarked
as he pocketed a handful of silver which he had
been counting behind the bar and came to the
table.</p>

<p>Conko watched the diminutive darky until he
stopped by his table. Then the lazy, lion-like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
eyes glowed with a yellow fire, and with a slapping
motion of his monstrous hand he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Shoo, fly, don’t bodder me!”</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts cackled like a nervous hen,
fluttered well out of reach of that hand, and
snickered:</p>

<p>“Lawd, Conko, you sho’ is one powerful funny
man! Dat gits you a free-fer-nothin’ drink.
You is better’n a show-actor.”</p>

<p>“You done kotch de lizard by de tail, son&mdash;kotch
him de fust time,” Conko informed him in
deep, rumbling bellow. “I is a holy show!”</p>

<p>“How is you feelin’ to-day, Conko?” Skeeter
asked as he set the drink before him.</p>

<p>“I feels like I is sorry I wus borned to die!”
Conko answered, swallowing the raw whisky with
one gulp and with a dry eye. “How is de bettin’
gittin’ on?”</p>

<p>“De niggers takes up eve’y bet, Conko,” Skeeter
replied. “You see, dis here Hitch Diamond&mdash;nobody
ain’t never knocked him out yit!”</p>

<p>“He ain’t never fit nobody yit,” Conko remarked
easily. “Befo’ dis day is over I’ll make
him wish he’d been borned a little nigger gal!”</p>

<p>“I hopes so,” Skeeter said with a nervous
flutter in his tone. “I done bet de limit. Ef it
ain’t a win wid you, I’s gwine hab de misforchine
to lose fawty dollars.”</p>

<p>With a pompous air Conko Mukes thrust his
hand into his pocket and brought out a large roll
of bills which had been carefully wrapped around a
fat corn-cob. He tossed it across the table.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>“Dar am fifteen dollars whut you kin bet fer me,
Skeeter. Dat many money says to you dat I’s
gwine make Hitch Diamond dig a hole in de groun’
to git away from de Georgia Cyclome.”</p>

<p>“Hitch specify dat he gwine rub his gloves wid
hoodoo-juice,” Skeeter said as he fumbled with
the corn-cob. “Ain’t you got no stunts like dat
to pull on?”</p>

<p>Conko Mukes opened his eyes with a sudden
and tremendous interest. He sat for a moment
in deep thought. Then he answered in a regretful
tone:</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, I ain’t never studied ’bout dat
befo’. I don’t depen’ on no hoodoo-juice. I
depen’s on elbow-grease! I fights straight, and
hits hard, an’ knocks ’em out on de level.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, elbow-grease is powerful good,”
Skeeter said uneasily; “but I figgers dat us oughter
hab all de he’p we kin git! Of co’se, I don’t b’lieve
in no hoodoo myse’f, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Us don’t need no hoodoo,” Conko interrupted.
“Let Hitch Diamond git it. He needs it. He
don’t know it yit, but he needs a dorctor, a preacher,
a undertaker, an’ a nice, deep grave in de cem’tery!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be so powerful shore ’bout dat,
Conko,” Skeeter suggested. “You ain’t never
seed dat Hitch Diamond pufform.”</p>

<p>“Whut sort lookin’ coon is he?” Conko asked.</p>

<p>“He’s mo’ tall dan you, wider dan you, heavier
dan you is. He’s got arms long enough to hug
a elerphunt aroun’ de stomick.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>“I’ll break dem long arms in fo’ pieces an’ wrop
’em aroun’ Hitch’s neck like a mournin’ rag,”
Conko declared.</p>

<p>“Hitch kin put his hands on yo’ head an’ mash
yo’ face plum’ down in yo’ stomick&mdash;jes’ like you
wus a mud-turkle!” Skeeter said.</p>

<p>“He won’t git no chance to mash,” Conko assured
him. “I’ll make him think he’s got bofe
hands tied behime him an’ bofe behime foots
kotch in a bear-trap.”</p>

<p>“Hitch won’t take but two licks at you,”
Skeeter continued. “One’ll be a up-cut whut’ll
punch you in de air like a balloom; den he’ll take
a side-swipe at you when you is comin’ down,
an’ phish!&mdash;you’ll be over on de yuther side of
Jordan!”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Conko grunted. “Whut you reckin
I’ll be doin’ to him when I’s comin’ down?”</p>

<p>“De las’ time Hitch had a prize-fight,” Skeeter
remarked, as he tried to roll a cigarette with
fingers which trembled and spilled all the tobacco,
“he specify dat he didn’t need but one glove, an’
he made em tie it on his <i>elbow</i>. He fiddled aroun’
an’ dodged dat big stiff till de nigger got in reach
of dat elbow; den Hitch gib him a little jab in his
soul-complexion, an’ dat nigger went to heaben
fer a week!”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Conko grunted. “Hitch’ll need gloves
on his elbows to-day, too. But he’ll want ’em
to keep him from hurtin’ his crazy-bones when I
knocks him down.”</p>

<p>“Hitch Diamond challenged Jack Johnsing,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Skeeter declared. “An’ you know whut dat nigger
champeen of de worl’ went an’ done? He got
on a big ferry-boat an’ went to Framce an’ specify
dat he wustn’t never comin’ back to dis country
no mo’!”</p>

<p>“Jack Johnsing got skeared too soon,” Conko
replied easily. “I always said he had a yeller
streak.”</p>

<p>“I seed Hitch fight a bear once,” Skeeter informed
him. “He kotch dat bear by de tail, an’
dat bear gib one loud squall an’ drug Hitch plum’
to Arkansas befo’ Hitch could let loose his handholt!”</p>

<p>“Huh,” Conko grunted, undismayed. “I ain’t
got no tail.”</p>

<p>Skeeter stopped. His thought could go no
higher. His imagination could reach no further.</p>

<p>Conko lighted a big cigar and puffed smoke
like a steam-engine. He laid two monstrous
hands, palm upward, upon the table between
them and remarked:</p>

<p>“Dese here hands needs exoncise, Skeeter.
Hitch Diamond is shore gwine make a good
punchin’ bag.”</p>

<p>“I hopes you gits yo’ punch in fust,” Skeeter
sighed, wishing that he had not bet so heavily.</p>

<p>“Whut’s de matter wid you?” Conko Mukes
bawled. “Is you gittin’ cold foots?”</p>

<p>“Naw. Nothin’ like dat,” Skeeter hastened
to assure him, “but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no need to git anxious,” Conko declared
as he rose to go. “You go out an’ bet my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
money, an’ remember dat de Georgia Cyclome
is a real twister.”</p>

<p>“Hitch is a stem-winder, too,” Skeeter declared.</p>

<p>As Conko Mukes tramped out of the saloon,
Skeeter Butts wiped the clammy sweat from his
face and sighed.</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” he moaned. “I tried to skeer dat
nigger up so he’d be keerful, but Conko don’t
take no skeer. Leastwise, he don’t talk dat way.
I got de hunch dat he ain’t nothin’ but beef an’
wind an’ a loud noise. I bet I’s gwine lose eve’y
bet whut I done bet. Dat’s de bes’ bet I could
bet!”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Conko Mukes meditated as he walked
slowly toward that portion of Tickfall inhabited
by the whites. “Dat Skeeter Butts specify dat
Hitch Diamond is some fightin’ coon. I wish
I hadn’t bet dem fifteen dollars; I cain’t affode to
lose ’em. I needs he’p. Wonder whar I could git
some of dat hoodoo-juice?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Professor Dodo Zodono, medium, magician,
hypnotist, stood on a box in front of the Tickfall
drug-store, adjusted the joints of his flute, and placed
it to his lips. The sweet, piercing notes quickly
drew a crowd around him.</p>

<p>The professor was tall and thin, with long black
hair, big black eyes, a long mustache, and long,
snaky fingers. His black clothes appeared to hang
upon his emaciated form like draperies, a circumstance
which helped him greatly in his sleight-of-hand
tricks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>Two assistants stood on the ground beside the
box. Both were tall and very thin, with lank,
damp hair and listless, humid eyes, and tallow-colored
skin always moist with nervous sweat&mdash;you
have seen many like them lying in hypnotic
sleep in some show window, or have peered down a
wooden chute to see them slumbering in a coffin
six feet under the ground.</p>

<p>When the music ended Professor Zodono handed
his flute to one of his assistants and began his spiel:</p>

<p>“Fellow citizens, I have called you together to
give you a little demonstration of my powers.</p>

<p>“We are surrounded by mystery. There is a
vast realm of the unknown which science has not
explored. I shall demonstrate to you to-night
that we have not yet even reached the edge of
the great ocean of discovery&mdash;price of admission,
fifteen and twenty-five cents!</p>

<p>“I shall show you wonders which cannot be
accounted for. You will hear sounds which defy
the laws of acoustics. You will behold appearances
which fly in the face of investigation, and
effects which do not appear to have a sufficient
cause&mdash;all for the insignificant price of fifteen and
twenty-five cents!</p>

<p>“I shall now give you a free demonstration of
hypnotism. This is no new thing, and I do not
charge you a cent to see an old and familiar stunt.
It is nothing but a nervous sleep induced by the
active mind of the operator upon the subjective
consciousness of the hypnotic. This power has
been known to the world for eighteen hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
years. Under this influence, the operator can
make his subject dance, sing, speak, or perform
any stunt he pleases. In New York, Dr. Meseran
hypnotized Sandow, the modern Samson, and that
giant who could lift three hundred pounds above
his head with one hand could not even lift his
hand to his head to scratch his ear&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At this point there was a slight commotion in
the closely packed crowd in front of Zodono. A
giant darky gorgeously dressed was pressing himself
to the front. It was Conko Mukes.</p>

<p>His manner and speech, as he pushed aside both
whites and blacks, were the very apotheosis of
deference and courtesy:</p>

<p>“’Scuse me, boss! Beg parding, kunnel! Fer
Gawd’s sake, don’t lemme disturb you-alls! Gotter
git to de drug-sto’ prompt, cap’n. Please, suh,
let a po’ mis’ble nigger git by fer de white folks’
med’cine. Thank ’e, suh, de Lawd is shore gwine
bless you fer dis nigger’s sake.”</p>

<p>By the time Conko Mukes was within four feet
of the box on which Zodono stood, the professor
had resumed his speech and the crowd had forgotten
the interruption. Mukes stopped where
he was and listened.</p>

<p>“Every positive character in the world has this
power of hypnotism over every negative character,”
the professor proclaimed. “It is the simple power
of mind over mind by suggestion&mdash;all of which I
shall prove to you to-night at the opera-house
for a few nickels admission&mdash;price, fifteen and
twenty-five cents!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>At this point one of the professor’s assistants
walked toward the box, his feet dragging and
moving as if some one had him by the shoulders,
leading him forward. His thin arms dangled
at his sides, and his bony fingers twitched and
writhed like the tail of a snake.</p>

<p>He climbed upon the box with awkward movements
as if the joints of his shoulders and hips
were stiff and the hinges rusty, and they hurt
him.</p>

<p>He walked slowly, reluctantly toward Zodono,
and the professor threw up his hand, snapped his
fingers, and cried “Stop!”</p>

<p>The assistant flinched, dodged like a dog, and
the crowd snickered.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” Conko Mukes mumbled in a
low tone. “Look at dat!”</p>

<p>For a moment the professor glared in the eyes
of his assistant; then his hands began making
slow, stroking motions downward before the
subject’s face. Red spots came and went in the
bleached cheeks of the hypnotic; his breath was
short and quick; his nostrils and lips were pinched.</p>

<p>The crowd looked on breathlessly as the hand of
the professor, fingers outstretched, clawed the air
before that weak, chalky face, with its twitching
lips and feeble, trembling chin.</p>

<p>“Ah!” the professor exclaimed theatrically,
grinning his triumph in the face of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Ah!” the crowd echoed with an expulsive
sound of breath released after a moment of breathless
attention.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>The man stood before them, asleep on his feet,
his body waving slowly like a feather suspended
from a thread and gently wafted by a slight breeze.</p>

<p>The druggist and his two clerks came out,
picked up the hypnotic, who was as stiff as a
board; carried him into the drug-store, and laid
him flat on his back in the show window.</p>

<p>Then the druggist unfolded a sheet, covered the
body, tucked the covering close around the sleeper’s
chalky face, and stepped across the store to the
soda-fountain with an eye alert and a hand ready
for trade.</p>

<p>“Remember, gents!” Professor Zodono exclaimed.
“An educational and instructive show
for men, women, and children&mdash;opera-house to-night
at eight o’clock sharp&mdash;fifteen and twenty-five
cents!”</p>

<p>Then, followed by his other assistant, the professor
walked slowly up the street to the opera-house
to dress the stage for his evening’s performance.</p>

<p>They were followed at a respectful distance by
Conko Mukes.</p>

<p>The moment the two men had passed out of
sight through the stage entrance in the alley by the
Gaitskill store, Conko Mukes knocked on the door.</p>

<p>“Open up, Bill!” Zodono commanded. “I
guess that is the nigger washwoman come after
those curtains.”</p>

<p>When Conko Mukes entered, Zodono came
forward.</p>

<p>“Have you come after the washing?” he asked.</p>

<p>Conko Mukes took off his hat, and his immense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
mouth with its mashed and shapeless lips spread
wide in an ugly grin.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me, Mister Jimmy?” Conko
asked.</p>

<p>“My Lord!” Zodono exclaimed after a moment’s
inspection. “You damn’ ole coon! What you
doing in this place, Conko?”</p>

<p>“I had to take a good riddunce of Georgia, Mr.
Jimmy,” Conko growled, grinning like a bear.
“De gram jury lawed me all de time an’ dat place
got too hot. How is all de white folks an’ de niggers
in Tupelo?”</p>

<p>“Fine&mdash;when I saw them last,” Zodono grinned.
“The grand jury lawed me, too, and I left.”</p>

<p>“Is dat how come you change yo’ name?”
Conko asked in polite tones.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; it wasn’t as bad as that,” Zodono
laughed. “But I could never make any money
in my business with my real name. A spiritualistic
medium, fortune-teller, magician, and hypnotist
named Jim Skaggs&mdash;that would never do. What
are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I’se prize-fightin’, Mr. Jimmy. I been fightin’
up’n down de Mississippi River, an’ I come here
to git a fight dis atternoon wid a nigger named
Hitch Diamond.”</p>

<p>“How did you like my show out in front?”
Zodono asked.</p>

<p>“It wus fine, Mr. Jimmy!” Conko exclaimed in
enthusiastic tones. “Dat’s how come I wants
to see you. I would like to ’terrogate you ’bout
dat show.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>“What do you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Whut I axes you is dis,” Conko began; “you
s’pose a nigger could learn how to hypnertize like
you?”</p>

<p>Zodono looked at Bill, his assistant, and winked.
Then he answered:</p>

<p>“Certainly, Conko.”</p>

<p>“How is it did, boss?” the negro asked eagerly.</p>

<p>Zodono looked at the negro for a moment then
grinned. He looked at Bill and Bill grinned back.
Here was a chance to have some fun.</p>

<p>“You’re getting ready to pull some hypnotic
stunt in that prize-fight this afternoon, ain’t you
Conko?” the professor asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Conko chuckled like a rumbling
train. “I figger ef I could put dat fightin’ coon
to sleep like you done dat white boy in front of de
drug-sto’, dat I could knock him out widout
wastin’ so much wind an’ elbow-grease.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Professor Zodono began, “first you
walk straight up to the subject and look into
his eyes.”</p>

<p>“Which eye does you look at his eyes wid?”
Conko asked.</p>

<p>“Both eyes&mdash;your own eyes!” Zodono explained.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh.”</p>

<p>“Then you make a stroking motion in front of
his face with the fingers of your hand extended
like you were combing wool&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh; you paws at him.”</p>

<p>“Then you bring your dominant will to bear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
upon the subject’s subconscious mind, willing
him to sleep&mdash;to stand upright and sleep&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dat sounds easy,” Conko grinned.</p>

<p>“Do you think you could do that?” Zodono
inquired.</p>

<p>“Suttinly. Dat is&mdash;mebbe so. I’d shore like to
try it one time befo’ I hypnertized dat fightin’
coon&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll let you try it on a white man.
If you can hypnotize a white man, you can certainly
come it over on a nigger. We’ll try it on
Bill.”</p>

<p>Zodono turned and glanced at his assistant.
That glance was like the stroke of a whip-lash,
and Bill quailed and flinched, the grin faded from
his face, and the flush changed to a deadly pallor.</p>

<p>“Now, Conko,” Zodono commanded. “Walk
right up to Bill. Look straight into his eyes.”</p>

<p>Bill stood like a rag doll, or anything else you
can think of which is spineless and helpless and
non-resistant.</p>

<p>Conko walked up and glared into Bill’s listless,
humid eyes like a monstrous, bloodthirsty gorilla
eying a wax dummy. Bill did not see the negro,
for unknown to Conko, the tall form of Zodono
stood just behind him, and the professor’s eyes
held the hypnotic as a snake charms a bird.</p>

<p>“Now,” Zodono commanded in sharp tones to
the darky, “make a stroking motion before his
face&mdash;slow&mdash;slow&mdash;slow. Now bring your will
to bear upon his subconscious mind&mdash;that’s it.
Sleep&mdash;sleep&mdash;sleep&mdash;ah!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>With a horrified expression upon his face, Conko
stood staring at the face of the man before him.
The hypnotic slowly teetered forward and backward,
threatening with each swaying movement
to lose his balance and tumble over.</p>

<p>“Catch him!” Zodono commanded sharply.</p>

<p>Conko sprang forward and eased the falling
man to the floor.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” a strange negro voice exclaimed.
“Did anybody ever see de beat of dat?”</p>

<p>Professor Zodono wheeled and stared at the
frightened face of a large, full-bosomed, golden-brown
girl, whose long, straight, black hair clung
around her face, by contrast making her octoroon
complexion almost white. Her bold, black eyes
were big with wonder and awe, and the hands
clasped over her bosom were trembling.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” Zodono snapped.</p>

<p>“I come fer de washin’,” the girl stammered;
“but I wants to git outen here real prompt.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” the professor said, as he
walked over to a table where a pile of soiled curtains
were stacked. “That man is not dead; just
sleeping.”</p>

<p>The girl backed around behind Zodono and
peeped at Conko.</p>

<p>“Kin dat nigger wake dat white man up?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Zodono answered. Then he called to
Mukes: “Wake him up, Conko!”</p>

<p>Conko leaned over, shook Bill by the shoulder,
and bellowed:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>“Git up, Mr. Bill! De bossman say fer you to
git up!”</p>

<p>But Bill slept on. Zodono laughed.</p>

<p>“Bring your dominant mind to bear upon his
subjective consciousness, Conko,” he grinned.</p>

<p>Conko grabbed Bill on each side of his face,
glared into his eyes, and howled:</p>

<p>“Hey, Bill; git up! Don’t you hear me tellin’
you? Wake up!”</p>

<p>While this was going on, Zodono asked the girl:</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Dey calls me Goldie,” she answered, staring
at Conko Mukes.</p>

<p>“All right, Goldie. Be sure to bring the curtains
back to-morrow.”</p>

<p>But Goldie was not listening. She was watching
Conko struggling with the inert form of Bill.</p>

<p>Finally Conko stood up and strode toward the
exit, his ugly black face frightened and uneasy.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Conko?” Zodono called.
“Going?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. I’s gwine, Mr. Jimmy,” Conko
answered nervously. “I&mdash;I&mdash;done got dat white
man hypped, an’ I&mdash;I&mdash;cain’t unhyp him!”</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, Conko passed
out of the theater, trotted down the crooked alley,
and hastened to the Hen-Scratch saloon.</p>

<p>“Skeeter!” he boomed. “If you got any
money to bet, you bet it on me! I’s gwine to pull
a stunt on dat Hitch Diamond dis atternoon
whut’ll make all de coons in Tickfall think I
done borrered de debbil’s own knockout draps!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>A short distance from Tickfall where the Dorfoche
Bayou widened into a small lake, and where
pine-trees grew thick and shady upon a sandy
plain was the negro baseball park and picnic
grounds.</p>

<p>Hundreds of negroes had assembled here to
witness the prize-fight between Hitch Diamond,
the Tickfall Tiger, and Conko Mukes, the Georgia
Cyclone. The women were as numerous as the
men, and all were betting wildly on the result.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts, backing Conko Mukes, was in a
blue funk.</p>

<p>He had bet forty dollars, and called that the
limit until Conko informed him that he possessed
a hoodoo-stunt which would decide the contest in
his own favor; then Skeeter had hazarded sixty
dollars more. He found takers so readily that he
had lost all courage and enthusiasm for his pugilist.
He considered his money as good as gone.</p>

<p>A rude, squared ring had been roped off on the
edge of the little lake by the simple process of
stretching the rope from one sapling to another
as a woman fixes a clothes-line. The ground,
rising from the edge of the water presented a
natural amphitheater for the accommodation of
the spectators.</p>

<p>Many a prize-fight had occurred at this spot,
in most of which the whites had taken a prominent
part, being interested spectators and extravagant
gamblers. But to-day no white people were on
the ground.</p>

<p>When Hitch Diamond emerged from the plum-thicket
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
which had served for a dressing-room, his
seconds behind him, and stalked through the
crowd to the ring, a wild burst of greeting and
applause went up from his waiting fellow townsmen,
all of whom, except Skeeter Butts and Figger
Bush, had backed him to the limit at any odds.</p>

<p>Hitch bowed right and left, waved his giant
arms at the people on the edge of the crowd, and
listened with hungry ears to their pleas:</p>

<p>“We’re bettin’ on you, Hitch; don’t make us lose
our money!”</p>

<p>“Knock him out, Hitchey! Den us’ll all be
rich!”</p>

<p>Hitch ducked through the ropes and walked to
his corner, where he sat down upon a folding stool.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts, the referee, came over and shook
Hitch by the hand. Atts was a broken-down
pugilist whom the Lord had called to preach
after his last K. O., and he and Hitch were great
friends.</p>

<p>“How you feelin’, Hitchey?” Vinegar wanted
to know.</p>

<p>“Feel as sweet as a fly in a vat of merlasses,”
Hitch grinned.</p>

<p>“Don’t let yo’ knock-out punch git sour,”
Vinegar grinned. “I got all my loose change on
you.”</p>

<p>There was another roar of applause, and Conko
Mukes emerged from his plum-thicket and came
through the crowd, his knotty, shaved head shining
in the sun like a block of ivory. His scarred and
villainous face, with its mashed lips and broken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
nose and iron jaw, glowed with excitement and
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The mob applauded without partizanship as he
climbed through the ropes and sat down in his
corner.</p>

<p>Each pugilist eyed the other curiously, but
neither could see much, for both were swathed
in horse-blankets.</p>

<p>Prince Total and a scar-faced negro named
Possum, Hitch Diamond’s seconds, slipped on
Hitch’s gloves and laced them tight, while Skeeter
Butts and Figger Bush performed the same office
for Conko Mukes.</p>

<p>Then the seconds removed the heavy woolen
horse-blankets, and the two fighters stood forth
in their ring costumes, visible in all their fighting
strength for the first time to the crowd&mdash;both men
deep-chested, heavy-thewed, with muscles which
moved like live snakes under their black-satin
skins, their bodies acrawl with life and brutal
power.</p>

<p>The two men advanced and touched gloves.</p>

<p>Then something happened which would make
old John L. Sullivan laugh till he dislocated his
iron jaw.</p>

<p>You who follow the fistic combats of Jess
Willard and other white hopes and hopelessnesses,
know that for months before the combatants
meet in the ring their press-agents are busy informing
the public what each pugilist says he
expects to do to his opponent.</p>

<p>In the negro prize-fights in the South, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
pugilist, lacking the press-agent, demands the
right to make a speech before each round of
the fight, in which he tells his friends and backers
what he expects to do to his opponent in the next
round.</p>

<p>Can you beat that?</p>

<p>So, in accordance with this custom, after the
two fighters had touched gloves, Hitch Diamond
went back to his corner and sat down.</p>

<p>Conko Mukes stepped to the middle of the ring
and bellowed:</p>

<p>“I’s de great unwhupped Tuskeegee Cyclome.
I fights any nigger whut misdoubts my words!
I’s de brayin’ jackass of Georgia, an’ no nigger in
Tickfall cain’t comb my mane!”</p>

<p>He sprang up, cracked his heels together,
waved his gorilla-like arms in the air, and uttered
a piercing whoop which echoed like a steam-whistle
far down the Dorfoche Bayou.</p>

<p>Thereupon Hitch Diamond sprang to his feet
and howled:</p>

<p>“I fights any nigger in the worl’ fer two bits,
fer a chaw terbaccer, fer a watermillyum rind,
fer de tail of a tadpole!”</p>

<p>He jumped three feet in the air, cracked his
heels together like two clapboards, and shrieked:</p>

<p>“I’s de Tickfall Tiger, an’ I kin curry dat Georgia
jackass fo’ inches under his hide!”</p>

<p>Then the seconds clattered out of the ring with
their folding stools, and the two men advanced and
took their fighting attitudes.</p>

<p>Pap Curtain picked up a baseball bat and struck
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
a large wagon-tire suspended from a tree on the
edge of the bayou. This was the gong.</p>

<p class="caption">“I’se de braying jack-ass of Georgia, an’ no nigger
in Tickfall cain’t comb my mane.”</p></div>

<p>“Time!” the referee shouted.</p>

<p>“Go fer his stomick, Conko!” Skeeter Butts
squealed. “Hit an’ duck! It’s de best thing
you kin do!”</p>

<p>Conko hit and ducked; and Hitch Diamond
was jarred to the very marrow of his bones. A
cold fury took the place of Hitch’s smile.</p>

<p>“Go atter him! Foller him up!” Skeeter
squealed.</p>

<p>Conko shot a right hook at Hitch, who neatly
side-stepped; then Hitch swung a terrible lefthand
blow at the giant figure before him.</p>

<p>“Right cross&mdash;lef’ hook, Hitch&mdash;dat’ll fix him!”
Prince Total barked.</p>

<p>Conko ducked and saved his jaw, but the blow
landed on the side of his head. It was too high
up to be vitally effective, but powerful enough
to bring a black veil of unconsciousness across
Conko’s mind. All faces vanished for a second;
even Hitch Diamond disappeared; then when
Hitch reappeared, Conko pecked savagely at his
stomach.</p>

<p>Hitch panted like a winded dog; they clinched,
and Hitch, with his gorilla reach, pounded his
enemy over the kidneys.</p>

<p>“Hey, dar! Break ’em! No fair hittin’ in
clinches!” the crowd of Conko backers yelled.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts grinned, yanked the pair out of
the clinch, and a wolflike howl rose from the
crowd. Hitch Diamond had landed a mighty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
blow in Conko’s stomach, and the Georgia Cyclone
had fallen to his knees!</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts began to count:</p>

<p>“Fo’&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;seben&mdash;eight&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Git up, Conko!” Skeeter Butts screamed in
agony. “Fer Gawd’s sake&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nine&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Conko’s leap upward at this word carried him
within striking distance of Hitch Diamond, and
the crowd yelled wildly at a whirlwind rush which
sent Hitch slipping and leaping like a flying
shuttle to guard himself from the wild insurgence
of that furious onslaught.</p>

<p>The end of the round found both combatants
laughing.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts, for his part, was alternately
sweating cold and hot, and as nervous as a cat
amid a pack of pop-crackers.</p>

<p>The two men sat down in their corners, lying
back with outstretched legs, resting their arms
outstretched upon the ropes, gulping in the air
fanned at them from the towels of the seconds.
Their eyes were closed, and the roar of the crowd
was a mighty thunder in their ears.</p>

<p>The gong struck, and Conko Mukes stepped
to the middle of the ring.</p>

<p>“I done got dis here Hitch Diamond’s number!”
he bawled. “Hitch ain’t nothin’ but a big gob
of meat, an’ I’s gwine fry him in his own grease!
Ef you got any money to bet, bet it all on me. I’s
de wild ole ram of de Georgia swamp, an’ no nigger
cain’t pick de cockle-burs outen my wool!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>He bent his huge body, ducked his head in
excellent imitation of a sheep, and bleated loud
enough to be heard a mile.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond sprang to his feet and whooped:</p>

<p>“I’s de swamp wildcat whut kin claw de cockle-burs
outen dat ole buck’s wool!”</p>

<p>He screamed in perfect imitation of a Louisiana
panther and met Conko Mukes in the middle of the
ring.</p>

<p>Then Hitch Diamond presented a wonderful
exhibition of skill and quickness, going in and out
again, landing a blow to the eyes, to the jaw, to
the ribs, ducking a counter, dancing lightly away,
dancing lightly in, with quick, deft, dangerous
blows, rushing things, and waiting for an opening
left by that slow-moving man before him.</p>

<p>That opening came, and Hitch’s right arm
flashed into it, a right hook with all the weight of
his pouncing body behind it. Conko Mukes fell
like the rotten trunk of a tree falls in the forest.
The crowd sighed like a great furnace, and a ripple
of awestricken applause began close to the ringside
and rolled like a wave to the edge of the amphitheater.</p>

<p>As Conko took the count, a golden-brown girl
with large, bold, black eyes and long, straight, coal-black
hair which made her octoroon complexion
appear almost white, walked up close to the ring.
The hands clasped over her full bosom were
trembling, and her eyes glowed like coals of fire.</p>

<p>It was Goldie, Hitch Diamond’s wife.</p>

<p>“Look out, Hitchey!” she exclaimed. “Don’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
let dat Conko Mukes git too close to you! Knock
him out in dis round! I knows somepin ’bout
him dat you don’t know!”</p>

<p>“He don’t look so awful dangersome now, Goldie,”
Hitch replied, grinning at his wife, as she stood by
the ropes.</p>

<p>Conko Mukes had rolled over and knelt on one
knee, listening as Vinegar Atts stood over him
counting in a loud voice. At the ninth he arose.</p>

<p>Springing across the ring with lightning quickness,
Conko landed a blow on Hitch’s jaw just as
he turned away from his wife; with a grunt, Hitch
fell flat to the ground within reach of Goldie’s
hand. But the blow had been too hastily delivered
and missed the point of the jaw by an inch. In
an instant Hitch was up and fighting like a panther.</p>

<p>The rest of the round was a nigger whirlwind
finish. The darkies grappled like clumsy grizzlies,
punching, biting, wrestling, growling ferociously.
Around and around, they butted and pushed,
bellowing and braying, striking any sort of blows,
landing them everywhere they could, while the
crowd cheered each man as he gained a slight
advantage without partizanship.</p>

<p>When the men retired to their corners the
crowd went mad, and the voices were yelling:
“Go it, Hitch!” “Knock his block off, Conko!”
“Kill him dead, Hitch!” “You’ll git him in
de nex’ round, Conko!”</p>

<p>As for Skeeter Butts, he could have qualified
for the lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>“Fer Gawd’s sake, Conko,” he chattered, “ef
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
you got any hoodoo stunts to wuck on Hitch, you
better wuck ’em. Dat nigger’s done had you down
two times&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aw, shut up!” Conko rumbled as he breathed
in the air from Skeeter’s flapping towel. “I’s
gwine pull dat stuff in de nex’ round. I’s savin’
it fer de third, because de third time is de
charm.”</p>

<p>“De Lawd’ll shorely bless you fer sayin’ that,
Conko,” Skeeter panted, with tears in his eyes.
“My Gawd, ef us don’t win, I’ll sho’ wish I’d been
borned a corn-field mule!”</p>

<p>The gong sounded for the third round.</p>

<p>Conko Mukes stepped in the middle of the ring
and howled:</p>

<p>“In dis here nex’ roun’ I’s gwine win out. I’s
gwine hypnertize dis here Hitch Diamond an’ put
him to sleep. I’ll take one look at his ugly mug
wid my right eye, an’ he’ll stan’ up in dis ring like a
dead man on his foots&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My Gawd, Hitchey!” Goldie screamed as
she pressed through the crowd and grabbed the
ropes by Hitch. “Look out fer dat nigger! He’ll
git you hypped, an’ he cain’t unhyp you!” Then
she turned and ran toward Tickfall like a yellow
streak.</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, sister!” Conko Mukes bellowed
as he watched her departure. “You don’t ’pear
to be anxious to stay an’ see it done, but dat’s
yo’ Uncle Conko’s little game! Dis here Hitch
Diamond is gwine to sleep, an’ I don’t keer ef he
never wakes up!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>As Conko sat down Hitch arose and smiled at
the crowd.</p>

<p>“I never goes to sleep till I wins!” he bawled.
“Conko is done made a miscue ’bout who is gwine
take a nap. I’s de real old fat mammy whut’ll
sing li’l’ baby Conko to sleep!”</p>

<p>Thereupon Conko Mukes performed a stunt
which had never before been witnessed in a
pugilistic ring, and which Conko in his subsequent
career never attempted to duplicate.</p>

<p>He sprang toward Hitch Diamond, sparred
for a moment, clinched, and shrieked like a calliope:</p>

<p>“Sleep! Sleep! Sleep, Hitch Diamond&mdash;go to
sleep!”</p>

<p>This wonderful performance scared Hitch Diamond
nearly out of his wits.</p>

<p>He broke from the clinch, smashed Conko against
the ropes, and then began hooking and driving all
sorts of blows against him, tearing himself out of
Conko’s frenzied clinches, punching him, shoving
him against the ropes again and again until the
cypress saplings to which the ropes were attached
bowed beneath the storm and weight of human
contestants.</p>

<p>Through it all, like some mighty chant, the
stentorian voice of Conko rumbled the dreadful
malediction:</p>

<p>“Sleep! Sleep! Go to sleep, Hitch Diamond&mdash;sleep!”</p>

<p>But Hitch never rested a moment, and Conko,
looking for an opening to get in his hypnotic eyework,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
let Hitch chase him all around the ring a
dozen times.</p>

<p>There were three minutes of this screaming farce,
and when it ended, Hitch Diamond was reeling
and staggering from his wild chase around the
ring, and his legs were cramping under him and
felt like lead.</p>

<p>Without knowing it, Hitch had spun around
like a top for three minutes, and a natural dizziness
was upon him, and before his bewildered eyes the
crowd of faces sagged and swayed, disappeared
and reappeared.</p>

<p>Again and again he had struck at Conko and
missed. When the round had ended, Hitch found
himself swinging on to Mukes with all his weight
to keep from falling to the floor, while Conko’s
bellowing was like the distant thunder of the surf
in his ear, sounding afar off:</p>

<p>“Sleep! Sleep! Sleep, Hitch Diamond, go to
sleep!”</p>

<p>When Conko Mukes walked to his corner he
was jubilant. He faced the crowd of wondering
coons, placed his gloved hands to the side of his
face, and crowed like a rooster.</p>

<p>“I got him goin’, niggers!” he squalled. “He’s
wabbly on his foots! One mo’ roundance, an’ dat
big fat stiff will go to sleep an’ never wake up
no mo’!”</p>

<p>He sank down upon his camp-stool, and his
heaving chest and abdomen sucked in the air in
great, hungry gulps.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts worked like an engine, cackling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
his delight at his hero’s wonderful pugilistic
ruse.</p>

<p>“You got him skeart, Conko,” Skeeter squawked
in a voice hoarse with excitement. “One mo’
roun’ wid dat hypnertize-eye, an’ dat’ll be his
finish. Don’t let him bat yo’ hoodoo-eyes out!”</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fourth round Conko
Mukes proceeded to steal some of Professor Dodo
Zodono’s thunder.</p>

<p>“Feller cit’zens,” he howled, “I’s gwine gib
you a little demerstration of my powers.</p>

<p>“In dis nex’ roun’, you’ll see wonders whut no
man cain’t account fer! You-all will hear noises
whut defy all de laws of soundance! You gwine
behold appearances whut fly in de face of scrutination!
Us is gwine demerstrate effecks whut ain’t
got no resomble cause&mdash;all free-fer-nothin’!”</p>

<p>He sat down with a happy grin on his horrible
face, and Hitch Diamond stood up to proclaim:</p>

<p>“I ain’t never fit in de ring wid no lunatic befo’.
I ain’t gwine waste no time gittin’ done wid dis
fight, neither. While Conko Mukes is pullin’ all
dem stunts he’s braggin’ ’bout, I’s gwine knock de
stuffin’ outen his black hide!”</p>

<p>The two men advanced to the center of the ring,
circled slowly around while Conko began his
monotonous, bellowing chant:</p>

<p>“Sleep! Sleep! Sleep, Hitch Diamond&mdash;sleep!”</p>

<p>Still keeping well out of reach of Hitch’s punch,
Conko waved his right hand slowly in front of his
opponent’s face, as if he were stroking invisible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
fur with his glove. Hitch followed him slowly,
waiting for a chance to land a knock-out blow.</p>

<p>Then upon Hitch Diamond’s slow mind there
slowly dawned the meaning of all this.</p>

<p>He had witnessed the hypnotic exhibition before
the drug-store earlier in the day, and recognized
portions of the speech which Conko had recited,
and noticed a similarity between Conko’s gestures
and the actions of Professor Dodo Zodono.</p>

<p>Then Hitch’s dull eyes began to glow with
strange interior fires.</p>

<p>With the negro’s knack for imitation, Hitch’s
gloved hands dropped, his giant arms dangled at
his sides, and he began to move toward Conko
Mukes with stiff legs, as if someone had him by
the shoulders leading him forward, as if the hinge
joints of his hips were rusty, and hurt him when he
walked.</p>

<p>The crowd gasped and uttered awe-stricken
exclamations.</p>

<p>Slowly Hitch advanced until he was well within
reach of Conko Mukes’s protruding jaw.</p>

<p>Then the sleepy lion suddenly thrust out a
raging paw&mdash;there was the sharp snap of leather
against human bone&mdash;an electric globe burst in
Conko Mukes’s puny brain, and darkness enveloped
the great originator of the pugilistic
hoodoo-eyes!</p>

<p>“I knows whut I done to dat big stiff!” Hitch
grinned as he turned to walk back to his corner.</p>

<p>Then a loud shout arose from the crowd and
Hitch whirled and looked behind him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>In spite of that terrific blow, Conko Mukes was
on his feet again!</p>

<p>The ropes around the rudely constructed ring
had been under such a strain during the fight that
when Conko Mukes reeled back against them
they broke, and the inert body of the pugilist
rolled into the ice-cold waters of Dorfoche Lake!</p>

<p>At the moment, when Conko rose and stood
waist-deep in the water of the little lake, he heard
a woman’s voice, screaming like a swamp panther:</p>

<p>“Run, niggers, run! De white folks is comin’!”</p>

<p>Conko looked up and beheld a hundred white
men following close behind Goldie Diamond, as the
girl ran toward them like a yellow streak, proclaiming
with a Gabriel-trumpet tone:</p>

<p>“Run, niggers, run! De white folks is comin’!”</p>

<p>For one tense moment the crowd of blacks
huddled together like quails bunch before a windstorm.
Then, with one voice, a squall of fear split
the sky, and the mob whirled like Dervishes and
bumped into each other like blind bugs in a tin
can.</p>

<p>After that, with one accord, they went into
the woods, leaping stumps and logs, tearing their
garments to shreds upon the snags and vines,
falling and rising again, miring themselves in
the muck of the swamp, howling like a wolf-pack,
their voices echoing through the forest with
terrifying reverberations.</p>

<p>Conko Mukes dived back into the lake, swam
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
across it, and hid in the deep marsh-grass on the
other side until after dark.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning, Sheriff John Flournoy met
Skeeter Butts and inquired:</p>

<p>“Skeeter, what made you niggers run off yesterday
when we came out to see the fight?”</p>

<p>“Dunno, Marse John,” Skeeter grinned. “You
know how niggers is. We figgered mebbe you
white folks didn’t favor prize-fights.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I don’t understand,” Flournoy
replied. “Goldie Diamond came running to
town and told us the niggers were having a prize-fight,
and when we went out to see it, she raised
a whoop and scared all the niggers away.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Skeeter grinned. “Dat’s whut
she done.”</p>

<p>“Why did she do it?” Flournoy persisted.</p>

<p>“Well, suh, I s’pose Goldie thought Hitch wus
gwine git knocked out. Anyways, I’s powerful
glad it happened, Marse John. Ef dat hadn’t
come to pass, Skeeter Butts would be bankbust
by dis time in de mawnin’.”</p>

<p>Flournoy turned away by no means satisfied,
but confident that there was some nigger secret
in the matter which the darkies would never
reveal.</p>

<p>Skeeter left him and hastened down to the
Hen-Scratch saloon where he found Hitch Diamond
and Conko Mukes waiting for him.</p>

<p>The two pugilists and their seconds had spent
nearly all night straightening out their finances
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
after the bets had been declared off, and the fight
had run off.</p>

<p>Conko Mukes had been drinking heavily and
was in a bad humor.</p>

<p>“I got jes’ one thing ag’in’ you, Hitch,” he
growled, “an’ dat is dat las’ punch you gib me on
de jaw. You acked like you wus hypnertized,
an’ I wusn’t lookin’ fer no punch. I don’t think
dat wus plum’ fair.”</p>

<p>“Dat shore wus a jolter, Conko,” Hitch grinned.
“Lawd, I’ll remember dat after I’m done dead!”</p>

<p>Conko Mukes’s eyes glowed with evil intent as
he listened to Hitch’s delighted chuckles. Finally
Conko said:</p>

<p>“But I fooled you ’bout dat hypnertize, Hitch.
You thought it wus my eyes, an’ I didn’t hyp
you wid my eyes.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a fack,” Hitch chuckled. “Whut did
you aim to use on me?”</p>

<p>“I hypnertized you wid my wavin’ hand, like
dis&mdash;” Conko explained as he rose to his feet to
illustrate. His right hand began a slow chopping
motion in front of Hitch’s face, and he continued:
“You gotter git up real close and wave slow&mdash;slow&mdash;slow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Suddenly Conko’s fist shot out with a blow like
a trip-hammer.</p>

<p>The punch would have broken his jaw&mdash;only
the jaw was not there.</p>

<p>Hitch ducked with lightning quickness and rose
to his feet ready for business.</p>

<p>Conko sprang toward the door, but tripped over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Hitch’s extended foot, and fell on his head with a
jar which shook two bottles off the shelf behind the
bar.</p>

<p>Hitch stooped and raised Conko to his feet,
backed him to the far end of the saloon away from
the door, and shoved him against the wall with
such force that a picture of Abraham “Lincum”
was dislodged from its nail and fell clattering to
the floor.</p>

<p>“Ef you wasn’t drunk, I’d kill you!” Hitch
bawled, while Conko stood looking around him
like a man in a dream. “As ’tis, I’s only gwine
put yo’ hoodoo eyes on de bum!”</p>

<p>The job was quickly, neatly done&mdash;two slight
taps on each side of Conko’s nose.</p>

<p>“Now git!” Hitch commanded, pointing toward
the door.</p>

<p>Conko Mukes did not linger. When the swinging
doors of the Hen-Scratch saloon closed behind
him, Hitch and Skeeter walked out to the street.</p>

<p>Far down the road a streak of flying dust marked
the route Conko had chosen as he left Tickfall
forever.

<p>“What are you doing here, nigger?”</p>

<p>Colonel Tom Gaitskill’s voice cracked like a whip
beside the ear of Pap Curtain.</p>

<p>Pap had three baseballs in his hand for which
he had paid a nickel, and which he intended to
throw at a row of nigger babies about forty feet
away. The tall baboon-faced negro, with shifty
eyes, furtive manner, and lips that sneered, started
like a frightened animal. The balls dropped
from his nerveless hands and he turned away.</p>

<p>“Fer Gawd’s sake, Marse Tom,” he chattered,
speaking under a visible strain, his eyeballs nearly
popping out of his head. “I shore didn’t soupspicion
dat you wus snoopin’ aroun’ here nowheres.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill’s face grew red with annoyance. The
veins in his neck swelled and his eyes snapped.</p>

<p>“Where are all those other coons?” he demanded.
“Did they run off too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh; dey said dar wus plenty time to pick
dat cotton an’ de trouts wus bitin’ fine down in de
bayou, so dey all hauled off and went fishin’.
Dey sont me to town fer some mo’ fishin’ lines, an’
I jes’ stopped here a minute to throw at dem rag
dolls&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>“I’m going out there and beat some sense into
those niggers with a black-snake whip,” Gaitskill
told him in a dangerously cool voice. “If you
don’t want some of it you’d better stay away,
understand? And if you ever put your foot in my
cotton-field again I’ll break your dashed neck!
Hear me?”</p>

<p>Pap Curtain stepped back and his voice became
a pleading whine. He glanced behind him to
assure himself that the road was clear for flight,
and began:</p>

<p>“Don’t do dat, Marse Tom. You know how
niggers is. Eve’y day is restin’ time an’ Sunday
fer a nigger; an’ when de trouts is bitin’ a nigger
jes’ nachelly cain’t wuck. It’s ag’in nature&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aw, shut up!” Gaitskill snarled in a savage
tone. “If a rain should come it would beat every
bit of my cotton off the stalks and bury it in the
mud, and you know it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I tell you whut I’ll do, boss,” Pap interrupted.
“You know I is always done jes’ whut you tole
me&mdash;because why? You is a powerful good white
man, an’ I ain’t nothin’ but a poor igernunt
nigger. Yes, suh, dat’s right.</p>

<p>“Now, ef you says de word, I’ll hike back to de
Niggerheel an’ tell dem niggers dat deir lives
ain’t fitten to last no time onless dey draps dem
fish-poles an’ drags dem cotton-sacks down de
row like de debbil wus bossin’ de job. Dar’s
fawty of ’em, Marse Tom&mdash;fawty, wuthless, no-’count,
good-fer-nothin’ coons done laid down deir
wuck an’ gone fishin’&mdash;dat’s whut dey done&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>Pap stopped. Keenly watching the tense lips
and the white, angry face of Gaitskill, he saw that
no nigger talk would placate the owner of the
Niggerheel. He stood shuffling his feet in the
dirt for a full minute before Gaitskill spoke.</p>

<p>“Now, Pap, I want you to get this: I have
trouble every year to get hands to pick my cotton.
The worthless niggers loaf on the banks
of the bayou until winter catches them with
nothing to eat, nothing to wear, and not a dollar.
Then the white folks in Tickfall have to support
them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s a shore, certain fack&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you crazy buck!” Gaitskill snarled.
“When I talk&mdash;you listen. You are the worst
idler and loafer in this town, and I tell you right
now that you had better leave this town. Hear
me? Pack up your rags right now and leave
Tickfall, and don’t ever come back again. If you
do I’ll have you arrested for vagrancy. Hurry
now! Get out before night!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lawdy, Marse Tom, I been livin’ in dis here
town fer sixty year&mdash;I’s dug all de water-wells fer
de livin’ an’ all de graves fer de dead&mdash;you an’
me is always got along peaceable ’thout no hard
feelin’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go on off!” Gaitskill commanded in hoarse
tones. “Hike!”</p>

<p>Gaitskill turned away, walked rapidly up the
street, and stepped into his automobile. There
was an explosive sound, a cloud of white smoke
hid the rear wheels for a moment, then the big
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
car swept into a side street, going toward the
Niggerheel plantation.</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy!” Pap Curtain sighed, as he
walked slowly down the street toward his cabin.
“De kunnel done gimme my good-riddunce papers
an’ axed me good-by!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pap sat down on the rickety porch of his cabin
and gazed for a long time with unseeing vision
straight before him. Half an hour passed, an
hour, and still he looked into the thick branches of
an umbrella china-tree without seeing it.</p>

<p>No white man can equal the absolute absorption
in thought, the intense concentration of
attention and interest which a negro displays
when he comes face to face with a crisis in his
career. And no white man can foretell a negro’s
mental conclusions in that hour of stress and
need.</p>

<p>Pap did not want to leave Tickfall, yet he knew
he had to go. Marse Tom’s word was law just
as much so as if the big, red-brick court-house had
suddenly formed a mouth and had spoken.</p>

<p>Pap rose from his chair, gave his shoulders a
vigorous shake, lit a vile-smelling corn-cob pipe,
changed the location of his chair from the porch
to the shade of the chinaberry tree, and began to
talk aloud to himself:</p>

<p>“Dat white man shore knifed me right under de
fifteenth rib! Treated me jes’ like I wus a houn’-dawg&mdash;‘git
outen dis town!’ Mebbe it’s all a
play-like an’ he didn’t mean nothin’&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>But the more he thought about the manner and
the speech of Colonel Gaitskill, the more the facts
compelled the conviction that it was his move.
Then the thought occurred to him:</p>

<p>“I wonder if dese here town niggers tipped Marse
Tom off ’bout me? A whole passel of ’em hates
me&mdash;I beats ’em gamblin’, an’ I beats ’em tradin’,
an’ dey all knows dey ain’t vigorous in deir mind
like me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Pap pondered for many minutes, his thick lips
pouting, his protruding eyes half closed, great drops
of sweat rolling down his face. His pipe went
out, the bowl became loosened and fell from the
stem, but he took no notice.</p>

<p>“Mebbe dem niggers is wucked a buzzo on me,
an’ mebbe dey ain’t,” he declared at last. “I
cain’t seem to make up my remembrance ’bout
dat. But I done decided on one fack: ef ole Pap
Curtain is gotter leave dis town, he’s gwine gib
dese here nigger bad-wishers of his’n a whole lot to
remember him by!”</p>

<p>He rose and walked down the street to the Hen-Scratch
saloon.</p>

<p>In the rear of the building he found Figger Bush.
Walking up to him with an air of great secrecy
and importance, Pap inquired:</p>

<p>“Figger, is you de proud persesser of a silber
dollar?”</p>

<p>“Sho’ is!” Figger grinned. “I gwine keep on
persessin’ it, too!”</p>

<p>“I sells tips!” Pap announced, taking a chair
beside Figger. “One dollar per tip per each!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>“It muss be wuth somepin’ ef it comes dat
high!” Figger exclaimed with popping eyeballs.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh; Marse Tom Gaitskill gimme de
word dis mawnin’, an’ tole me I could pass it on
to a choosen few&mdash;ef dey had a dollar!”</p>

<p>Figger Bush puffed nervously at his cigarette
and waited anxiously. Colonel Tom Gaitskill’s
name was one to conjure with, and Figger knew
that Curtain had been working on the Niggerheel
plantation.</p>

<p>“Whut’s de tip about, Pap?” Figger asked
eagerly, fumbling with the lonesome silver dollar
in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Dat would be tellin’,” Pap grinned, as he
leaned back and watched a tiny tree-spider floating
in the breeze on the end of its web.</p>

<p>Figger puffed unconsciously on his cigarette
until it burned down to his lips and scorched them;
he snatched it out of his mouth and blistered his
fingers; he slapped his foot upon it as it lay on the
ground, then sprang up with an exclamation and
nursed a bare spot on the side of his sockless foot
where the stub had burned him through a hole
in his shoe.</p>

<p>“Good gosh, set down!” Pap Curtain howled
as he watched Figger’s gyrations. “You gib me
de fidgets cuttin’ up dat way!”</p>

<p>Figger sank back in his seat, and Pap again
directed his attention to the operations of the
little spider, and waited.</p>

<p>“Cain’t you gimme no hint about de tip,
Pap?” Figger asked at last. “I wants to git in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
on somepin good, but I cain’t affode to waste no
money.”</p>

<p>“Cross yo’ heart an’ body dat you won’t tell
nobody an’ gimme de dollar. Den, when I tells
you de secret, ef it ’tain’t wuth a dollar, I’ll hand
you de loose change back.”</p>

<p>“Dat sounds resomble,” Figger declared, and the
silver dollar changed hands.</p>

<p>“Now, Figger, you listen,” Pap began in a
mysterious tone. “Don’t you tell nobody, fer
Marse Tom swore me dat he didn’t want nobody
to know but a choosen few. Marse Tom is gwine
gib a great, big, cotton-pickin’ festerble out at de
Niggerheel. He pays de best wages, an’ he wants
de bes’ pickers in de parish. De tickets is one
dollar, whut I collecks when I gibs de tip. All
de niggers is to meet Marse Tom at de bank dis
atternoon at three o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Figger grunted. “Dat shore sounds
good to me. Plenty grub, plenty wages, a barrel
of cider at de eend of de cotton-row, an’ all de
coons on a cotton-pickin’ picnic! Keep de dollar,
Pap. Me an’ Marse Tom is done made a trade.”</p>

<p>Enthusiastic over the idea, Figger sprang to his
feet and started away.</p>

<p>“You kin succulate de repote dat somepin’s
doin’, Figger,” Pap grinned. “But don’t you
gib dat tip away. Marse Tom spoke me special
’bout dat, an’ say he gwine bust de head open of
de nigger whut told de secret!”</p>

<p>Pap Curtain stepped into the rear of the Hen-Scratch
saloon, invested a part of Figger’s dollar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
in a long, strong Perique stogy, and came out
again. He sat for half an hour humming to himself,
chewing the end of the stogy, smoking slowly,
leisurely, and with profound meditation.</p>

<p>He was giving Figger time to circulate the report.
He knew that the grape-vine telephone was already
at work, and that the news of a big profitable deal
would trickle and ooze into every negro cabin in all
the negro settlements of Tickfall.</p>

<p>Prince Total was the first darky to make his
appearance.</p>

<p>“Whar’s yo’ silber dollar, Prince?” Pap exclaimed
with a broad grin before Prince had time
to state his business. “No busted niggers needn’t
apply&mdash;tickets is one dollar&mdash;Marse Tom’s own
price.”</p>

<p>“Whut is dis doin’s?” Prince inquired. “Is
Marse Tom gittin’ up a nigger excussion?”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de very game!” Pap snickered. “One
dollar per each ticket. Marse Tom leaves me to
pick de winners. Plenty brass-band music, plenty
ice-water on de way; dancin’ on de deck eve’y
night&mdash;all de real good arrangements whut niggers
likes. You-all knows how Marse Tom fixes things
up. Cross yo’ heart an’ body dat you won’t tell
an’ gimme one round silber dollar fer de tip!”</p>

<p>Prince crossed Pap’s palm with silver and
listened to his instructions:</p>

<p>“Go see Marse Tom at de bank at three o’clock
dis atternoon!”</p>

<p>“Excussion!” Prince panted. “My, dat’s a
shore ’nough word to ketch a nigger by de year.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Gib ’em somewhar to trabbel an’ a crowd to go
wid&mdash;Lawd, dat’s real good luck! I’s gwine out
an’ succulate dem repote!”</p>

<p>By high noon Pap Curtain’s pockets were
weighted with silver and he had revealed the
magical tip to over one hundred negroes.</p>

<p>“Dis here is suttinly a good joke,” he snickered;
“but ef I keeps it up too long I’s skeart I’ll laugh
myself to death. I got a hunch dat I better mosey
along todes de depot. Marse Tom done advise
me to leave dis town.”</p>

<p>When the slow accommodation train pulled
into the depot, Pap Curtain boarded it from the
side farthest from the station, took an obscure seat
in the negro coach, and did his best to attract no
attention as the train conveyed him away from
Tickfall.</p>

<p>Only one negro saw him go.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At three o’clock one of the clerks closed the big
glass doors of the Tickfall National Bank and went
back to his desk.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later there was a loud knock upon
the glass door, and the clerk looked up. What he
saw caused him to spring from his stool, overturning
it with a loud clatter upon the marble
floor, and go running down the corridor to the
president’s office.</p>

<p>“Come out here quick, Colonel!” the clerk
exclaimed, his hair standing on end and cold sweat
dampening his forehead. “God only knows what
has got into the heads of our negro depositors!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
Every nigger buck in Tickfall is lined up in front
of the bank, and the leader is knocking on the
door, trying to get in!”</p>

<p>Gaitskill jerked open a drawer, slipped a heavy
revolver in his side coat pocket, and stepped toward
the front.</p>

<p>Figger Bush’s shoe-brush mustache was pressed
close to the glass, his hands were cupped around
his eyes, and he was peering in to catch the first
glimpse of Marse Tom as he came out of his office.</p>

<p>“Here he am, niggers!” he bawled as the colonel
fumbled with the fastening of the door.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Marse Tom!” the greeting ran down
the line with every variation of tone like a child
playing a scale on the piano with one finger.</p>

<p>“Well?” Gaitskill demanded in a loud tone.
“What in the name of mud is the matter now?”</p>

<p>“Us is all come to git in on de picnic, Marse
Tom,” Figger Bush announced as spokesman.
“We all paid our dollar an’ Pap tipped us off to
come to de bank at closin’ time!”</p>

<p>“Pap did what?” Gaitskill snapped.</p>

<p>“He sold us a ticket to de excussion, Marse Tom,”
Figger informed him. “Yes, suh, we is powerful
glad you is gittin’ one up&mdash;peanuts an’ ice-water,
an’ plenty brass-band music&mdash;all us niggers favors
it fine!”</p>

<p>“What in the devil are you talking about?”
Gaitskill bawled.</p>

<p>“Dunno, Marse Tom,” Prince Total spoke up.
“Pap Curtain&mdash;he say you would tell us&mdash;it’s a
plum’ secret.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>“It certainly is!” Gaitskill howled, glaring at
the negroes with eyes blood-shot and apoplectic.
“It’s a deep, dark, impenetrable secret! Where is
that fool, Pap Curtain?”</p>

<p>“He went away on de dinner-time train, Marse
Tom,” a voice informed him. “I seed him!”</p>

<p>Gaitskill stood in the door of the bank in absolute
ignorance of the whole business, wondering
what to do. Finally he went back to Figger
Bush’s first statement:</p>

<p>“What did you say about a dollar?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Us paid a dollar fer de tip, Marse Tom,”
Figger replied.</p>

<p>Gaitskill’s eyes ran down the line as he counted
the negroes.</p>

<p>“Did all you darkies give Pap Curtain a dollar?”
he asked in a loud voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh!” one hundred and eighteen voices
answered in a mighty chorus.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” Gaitskill snorted, as he gazed
into their simple faces, marveling at their credulity.</p>

<p>Every merchant in town had closed his store to
see the fun. Nearly every white male inhabitant
of Tickfall was lined up across the street. The
crowd grinned its delight, and watched with
breathless interest while Gaitskill fumbled with
his problem in confusion and perplexity, and an
ignorance which the negroes would not enlighten.</p>

<p>Nothing tickles a Southern white man more
than to see another white man all snarled up and
in a jam of negro inanities. A fly in a barrel of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
molasses has about as good a chance of getting
out of the mess.</p>

<p>“What did Pap Curtain tell you bucks?” Gaitskill
bellowed.</p>

<p>There was a mighty clash of voices:</p>

<p>“He specify excussion&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dancin’ on de deck eve’y night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Music an’ free vittles&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Festerbul an’ juberlo&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Picnic&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Then a loud voice inquired in a wailing whine:</p>

<p>“Marse Tom, ef us don’t git all dem things Pap
promised us, does us git our dollars back?”</p>

<p>Gaitskill did not reply. Instead he took out
his watch and studied it carefully.</p>

<p>He was thinking: the old combination freight and
passenger train had left Tickfall at noon; it had
traveled for three hours and twenty minutes at a
speed of fifteen miles an hour. The train was not
yet out of Tickfall parish. Then Gaitskill spoke:</p>

<p>“All you niggers listen to me: Go down to
the old cotton-shed back of my house and wait
until I come. Hurry, now!”</p>

<p>He turned, entered the bank, locked the door
behind him, and strode to the telephone.</p>

<p>“Hello, Susie!” he said to the operator. “Gimme
the station-agent at Tonieville&mdash;quick!”</p>

<p>There was a nervous quiver in his strong voice,
and as he waited he drummed with his fingers on
the table, tapped the toe of one foot on the floor,
then snatched up a paper-weight and began to
grind it savagely into the blotter on a desk.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>The coons had exasperated him often enough,
he thought; but Pap Curtain had gone the limit.
He would catch that nigger and wring his fool
neck.</p>

<p>“Hey&mdash;hello!” he bawled through the speaking-tube.
“Is that you, Bill? This is Gaitskill&mdash;Say,
has No. 2 passed through Tonieville yet?
Coming now? All right, listen: tell the constable
to board the Jim-Crow coach on that train and
haul off a nigger&mdash;a yellow nigger with a baboon
face and shifty eyes and a mouth which sneers.
Yes! his name is Pap Curtain. He’s got a pocketful
of money. Sure! Haul him off. Tell the
constable to bring him back on No. I! Good-bye!”</p>

<p>Gaitskill hung up the receiver, wiped the sweat
from his face, and walked out of the bank, pausing
at the door long enough to inform the clerk:</p>

<p>“I’m going down to the cotton-shed, Frank.
Got to hold an executive session with those coons!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pap Curtain had the negro-coach all to himself.
He leaned back and sighed with a vast content.</p>

<p>“Dem coons tried to knife me, but I beat ’em
to it!” he snickered, as the train puffed slowly
along. “One hundred an’ eighteen dollars is
shore good wages fer a day’s wuck.”</p>

<p>He planned his expenditure of the money:
first a visit to New Orleans, and a happy time in
the negro resorts of that city. After that a job
on a steamboat which traveled down the river.
After a long time, a return to Tickfall and a renewal
of friendships with his negro neighbors.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>“Niggers don’t hold spite long,” he grinned.
“An’ money don’t bother ’em hardly at all,
whedder he makes it or loses it!”</p>

<p>The train stopped at Tonieville and Pap stuck
his head far out of the window to see who he
would know at the station.</p>

<p>He felt a sharp tap on his shoulder, pulled his
head in, and looked behind him.</p>

<p>A tall white man with tobacco-stained whiskers
and a deputy-sheriff’s badge pinned to a strap of
his suspenders spoke:</p>

<p>“Climb off peaceable, Pap Curtain! Colonel
Tom Gaitskill wants you back at Tickfall on the
next train!”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, white folks,” Pap protested earnestly,
his intense fright making him stammer.
“Marse Tom done run me outen Tickfall dis very
mawnin’. He tole me ef I didn’t leave town he
would bust my haid open. You done cotch de
wrong coon!”</p>

<p>“Git off!” the deputy commanded shortly,
waving his stick toward the door.</p>

<p>The train went on and left Pap Curtain at the
station in the care of the constable.</p>

<p>“You is shore made a miscue dis time, Mr.
Sheriff,” Pap declared. “Marse Tom is always
b’lieved in me an’ trusted me&mdash;Gawd bless his
heart! You cain’t make Marse Tom hear nothin’
bad ’bout me&mdash;naw, suh, you couldn’t bawl it
inter his year wid one of dese here Gabriel trumpets.
I’s a good nigger&mdash;a powerful good nigger!”</p>

<p>The grinning constable reached out with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
end of his stick and struck it sharply against one
of Pap’s bulging pockets. There was a pleasant
clink of much silver in response.</p>

<p>“Colonel Gaitskill telephoned that your pockets
were full of money,” the constable told him. “I’ll
let you pack it until we git back to Tickfall&mdash;then
you can tell your Marse Tom where you happened
to get it all.”</p>

<p>Pap Curtain’s legs suddenly grew weak, and he
sank down upon a depot truck and became silent.</p>

<p>He set himself to light a Perique stogy&mdash;one of
the two which he had bought from Skeeter Butts
for five cents&mdash;bought with Figger Bush’s money.
He broke three or four matches before he got a
light, and then repeatedly forgot to draw upon his
cigar.</p>

<p>It went out again and again, and he always had
trouble in relighting it. His hands trembled more
and more with each successive attempt.</p>

<p>“Lawd!” he sighed to himself. “Dey shore
got me now!”</p>

<p>The niggers had trusted him, and he had buncoed
them all. The place where his foot had
slipped was when he told them to go the bank to
see Marse Tom.</p>

<p>“White folks always gits nigger bizzness in a
jam,” he thought tearfully. “Dem niggers wus
suckers, but lawdymussy, I wus shore one big
whopper of a fool!”</p>

<p>The sweat stood in chill beads on his face. He
knew what the inside of the penitentiary looked
like&mdash;he had served a brief term in prison. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
had tried to make friends with the “nigger-dogs”&mdash;bloodhounds&mdash;but
it could not be done. He had
tried to escape; that, also, was a failure.</p>

<p class="caption">“Colonel Gaitskill telephoned me that your pockets
were full of money.”</p></div>

<p>“Lawd!” he mourned. “Dey got me dis
time!”</p>

<p>The north-bound express whistled for the
station. The agent ran out, flagged it, and the
deputy helped Pap climb on. Pap had suddenly
become an old and feeble man, broken, hopeless,
forsaken, shamed, dreading above everything his
return trip to Tickfall.</p>

<p>The deputy led him to a seat in the smoking car
and offered him a cigar. Pap gazed at him as if he
did not understand, then took the cigar and looked
at it as if he did not know what it was. All the
light had gone out of his eyes, and his face looked
like a scarred and wrinkled shell.</p>

<p>Detraining at Tickfall, the deputy waited for
Pap to get ahead of him. Pap, noticing his
gesture, muttered in a far-away voice, as in a
dream:</p>

<p>“Comin’, white folks! I’s right at yo’ hip!”</p>

<p>When Gaitskill, in response to a knock, opened
the door of the Tickfall National Bank to admit
them, he greeted the deputy in his strong, cordial
voice, conducted the two back to his private
office, and seated the sheriff and his prisoner in
two comfortable chairs.</p>

<p>“You brought him safe back, Sheriff,” Gaitskill
smiled cordially, as he seated himself. “Take
a cigar. Take two&mdash;here! Hold your pocket
open!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>He grabbed a handful of the cigars, slipped
them carefully into the deputy’s pocket, and sat
down again.</p>

<p>Pap Curtain watched them like a trapped wolf,
breathing in deep, audible gasps like a man choking.</p>

<p>Gaitskill’s face was genial and humorous, his
fine eyes twinkled, and he beamed upon Pap
Curtain with a smile as cordial as sunshine.</p>

<p>That smile sent the cold shivers up Pap’s spine,
and made the hair bristle and crinkle with terror
on the back of his neck. He had had dealings
with Marse Tom before, and he knew that Marse
Tom had no patience with a crooked, tricky nigger.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” Pap sighed. “Dat white man is
gwine hang me shore!”</p>

<p>Gaitskill pulled out a heavy purse, laid two
yellow-backed bills on the table in front of the
constable, and said:</p>

<p>“There’s your pay, Bob. Much obliged for
bringing my nigger back. I guess you want to
run around town a little before you go back.”</p>

<p>Bob grinned his appreciation, pocketed his
money, and strode out.</p>

<p>Gaitskill looked at Pap Curtain and broke out
in a loud laugh.</p>

<p>Great tears rolled down Pap Curtain’s face
and splashed upon the hands folded in his lap, but
Gaitskill took no notice.</p>

<p>“Now, Pap,” Gaitskill grinned, “that was a
great stunt you pulled off on me. What do you
think I ought to do to you for it?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<p>“Dunno, boss,” the negro quavered, leaning
over and resting his teary face upon his hands.</p>

<p>“How many of those niggers did you get?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t git any, Marse Tom,” Pap declared,
hoping to build up some sort of defense. “It wus
dat fool Figger Bush an’ Prince Total whut
succulated de repote!”</p>

<p>There was a wild yell up the street and a rumble
of wagon wheels.</p>

<p>Gaitskill sprang up and walked to the front
of the bank, where he could look through the
window.</p>

<p>Pap Curtain, trembling, horrified, followed Gaitskill
because he was afraid to remain alone.</p>

<p>Ten wagons passed the bank, the teams going
in a fast trot, each wagon containing ten or twelve
squalling blacks, who waved their hands at the
bank as far as they could see it.</p>

<p>Pap Curtain ducked behind the door and kept
himself invisible&mdash;for each wagon contained a
load of his victims!</p>

<p>“That’s your work, Pap!” Gaitskill grinned,
when the wagons had passed.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Pap answered in a weak, tearful,
hopeless voice.</p>

<p>“If I had known about it when I telephoned the
constable, I would not have had him bring you
back, Pap. I thought you had robbed all those
niggers of a dollar each.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Pap sighed, praying for more light.</p>

<p>Gaitskill took a ten-dollar bill out of his pocket,
felt its texture with a banker’s expert fingers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
then said in a voice which dripped with the sweetness
of appreciation and praise:</p>

<p>“That trick was the real stuff, Pap! How did
you ever think it up?”</p>

<p>Every pore of Pap’s body was spouting cold
sweat. His eyes burned, his throat choked, his
brain reeled, his limbs trembled&mdash;he was racked,
tortured with fear and anxiety&mdash;and yet this white
man seemed to be talking kind words.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lawd,” he prayed, “let a leetle sunshine
in!”</p>

<p>“It certainly takes a coon to catch a coon!”
Gaitskill laughed. “The idea of making a negro
pay a dollar for the privilege of working on a
cotton plantation when the white folks are begging
for hands&mdash;think of it, Pap!</p>

<p>“One hundred and eighteen niggers gone off on
a cotton-picking picnic to the Niggerheel plantation,
paying a dollar each for the privilege of
gathering a thousand bales of cotton, and swearing
that they will stick to the job because they paid
to get it! Say, nigger, you are the greatest coon
in Tickfall!”</p>

<p>Pap Curtain straightened up; his shoulders
came back with a snap; he drew a breath so deep
that it seemed to suck in all the air in the bank.</p>

<p>“I’m certainly much obliged to you, Pap,”
Gaitskill said earnestly. “I take back what I
said this morning. You’re a good nigger. Here’s
ten dollars for your trouble.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill opened the door.</p>

<p>Pap Curtain stepped out, holding the crinkling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
bill in his hand. He reeled down the street like a
drunken man, staggered across the village to
Dirty-Six, and sat down on the rickety porch of
his cabin.</p>

<p>The Gulf breeze swept across his sweat-drenched
face, cooling it like a breath from the land where
angels dwell.</p>

<p>Slowly his shattered nerves were composed;
slowly his trembling limbs were stilled; slowly his
twitching muscles quieted. He felt tired. He
breathed deeply, like a man who had emerged
from the depths of great water.</p>

<p>Then he filled his mouth with chewing tobacco
and grinned.</p>

<p>“Lawd!” he chuckled. “I’s powerful glad it
come out de way it done.”</p>

<p>His mind quickly reviewed each incident of this
exciting day, and as he watched the sun sink below
the horizon, he announced his conclusion:</p>

<p>“When Marse Tom tole me to leave dis town, he
jes’ nachelly overspoke hisse’f!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<h2 id="The_Cruise_of_the_Mud_Hen">The Cruise of the Mud Hen.</h2>

<p>Unthinking people assert that negroes do not
think.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when Skeeter Butts, by methods
peculiarly his own, became the high-proud owner
of a good, cheap automobile, he permitted only
three friends to ride with him,&mdash;Vinegar Atts,
Hitch Diamond, and Figger Bush.</p>

<p>Figger was necessary because his superb voice
added to the others, completed the most melodious
male quartette in Louisiana. Hitch Diamond
as a prize-fighter, Vinegar Atts as an ex-pugilist
who had been called to preach, each possessed
the physical strength of a forty-horse-power mule.
Skeeter needed them to lift his automobile out of
the mud and to push it through the sand.</p>

<p>Was not that a thoughtful selection of first-aids
to the helpless?</p>

<p>Truly, that outfit was a fearful and wonderful
thing.</p>

<p>When those four negroes climbed into that
car and began to sing to the accompaniment of a
mechanism which sounded like a saw-mill, a
cotton-gin, and a boiler factory loaded upon a log-train
chasing a herd of bleating billy-goats along
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
the public highway, the effect produced made
the pious cross themselves, the ungodly “cuss,”
and the little children run to their mothers,
whimpering with fright.</p>

<p>A white man might think a thousand years
and never think up an arrangement like that.</p>

<p>Then to show that his mental incubator was
still capable of hatching out little fuzzy, two-legged
chicken-headed thoughts, Skeeter bought a steamboat!</p>

<p>“Whar is Hitch Diamond at, Kunnel?” Skeeter
asked of a handsome, white-haired gentleman
standing in front of the Tickfall post-office.</p>

<p>“He’s up at my house, unloading fireworks
from a dray,” Colonel Gaitskill answered.</p>

<p>“Hitch don’t go back to wuck to-day, do he?”
Skeeter inquired in a shocked tone.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” Gaitskill smiled. “This is a
national holiday. I imagine Hitch has finished
that little job now. Are you folks going off to
make a day of it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, us is fixin’ to cel’brate, too!” Skeeter
chuckled.</p>

<p>“Do you know why we celebrate the Fourth of
July, Skeeter?” Gaitskill asked with a smile.</p>

<p>Skeeter knew. He also knew that “Fighting
Tom” Gaitskill stood before him, and this old
soldier had not fought with the heroes of ’76. He
tempered his answer to a hero of the Lost Cause.</p>

<p>“Shore, Marse Tom!” he chuckled. “Dis is
de day dat our white marsters kilt all de dam-yanks!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>Gaitskill laughed.</p>

<p>“Your answer is a credit to your tact and
diplomacy, Skeeter, but it certainly upsets the
records of history. Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“We’s gwine down to de river.”</p>

<p>“I want you and Hitch Diamond to help me
with the fire-works to-night,” Gaitskill said.
“You get back by dark.”</p>

<p>“Shore, Marse Tom!” Skeeter cackled. “We
ain’t gwine miss no free show. I’ll go git Hitch
an’ de rest of de bunch now!”</p>

<p>The seven-mile road to the Mississippi River was
smooth and level and was a favorite with Vinegar
and Hitch, who preferred riding to climbing out
to lift or push. So, one hour later, the automobile
quartette stood beside a stump on the
banks of that majestic stream and sang of the time
“when de water’s so low, de bullfrog roll up his
pants jes’ so, and wade acrost from sho’ to sho’;
while over in de channel de catfish say: ‘We’s
gittin’ plum’ freckle-faced down our way.’”</p>

<p>Six miles up the river at the bend, a little steamboat
whistle squalled at them through the still
July atmosphere. The quartette promptly sat
down and watched the boat’s approach.</p>

<p>The boat was about thirty feet long and about
eighteen feet wide, was built with a flat keel which
made it float on the top of the water like a cigar
box, and was propelled by a paddle wheel in the
rear about as big as a barrel.</p>

<p>Some river fishermen own such boats, living in
them, and peddling their fish to the negroes on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
the plantations along the river. The vessel could
ride the current down-stream and make six miles
an hour; going up-stream, it hugged the bank,
navigated the slack water, and got there as soon
as it could. Three miles an hour up-stream was
going some.</p>

<p>As the boat drew near, the quartette noticed
that the machinery was protected by a rudely-built
roof, and the crew consisted of one man who
sat on a three-legged stool, smoked a pipe, shoveled
coal, steered, and pulled the whistle-cord, and
still had plenty of time to watch the scenery.</p>

<p>“Dat’s de life fer me,” Skeeter Butts exclaimed.
“Up ’n’ down de river, fishin’ an’ swimmin’ an’
sleepin’. Ef I owned a steamboat like dat, I’d
go right back to Tickfall an’ ax all my friends
good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Me, too!” Vinegar Atts rumbled. “Ef I
had a boat, I’d trabbel dis river givin’ religium
advices to all de niggers on de river plantations.
I’d preach eve’y night an’ I wouldn’t fergit to ax
some hones’ brudder to pass de hat.”</p>

<p>“Steamboats is got some good p’ints over autermobiles,”
Hitch Diamond growled. “You don’t
got to lift ’em outen de mud or push ’em up-hill
through de sand.”</p>

<p>“Ef I had a boat,” Figger Bush cackled, pulling
at his little shoe-brush mustache, “I’d buy me a
derby hat an’ a grassaphome, an’ a long-tail
prancin’-albert coat, an’&mdash;an’&mdash;I’d climb up on
top of it an’ sing all de songs I knows.”</p>

<p>The whistle squalled again.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>“She’s fixin’ to make a landin’!” Skeeter
exclaimed.</p>

<p>The boat passed them on the current, then
turned and puffed along the bank through the
still water opposite to where they were sitting.
A black, chunky, bull-necked negro, the whites
of whose eyes shone across the water like china
door-knobs, hurled a rope toward them.</p>

<p>“Gimme a turn aroun’ dat stump!” he bellowed,
as he stopped the machinery.</p>

<p>While the quartet tied the boat the owner
stepped into a little canoe and paddled ashore.</p>

<p>“Howdy, brudders!” he bellowed, as he sat
down with them. “My name is Pipe Smash.”</p>

<p>“Us is got names, too,” Skeeter Butts proclaimed,
as he introduced himself and his friends. “We been
watchin’ you’ boat an’ wishin’ dat we had one.”</p>

<p>Smash hesitated just a second before answering.
An eager look flashed in his eyes and vanished.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“’Tain’t such a awful rotten dawg’s life fer a
nigger&mdash;livin’ on you’ own boat. I’s jes’ mournin’
in my mind because I’s got to quit it.”</p>

<p>“How come?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>“I’s gittin’ married real soon an’ de gal specify
dat she don’t want no home whut floats aroun’
permiscus so dat de chickens don’t know whar to
come to roost. She wants me to sell out an’
sottle down on dry land.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a powerful sensible notion,” Skeeter
Butts proclaimed, as his appraising eyes searched
the steamboat. “Is you foun’ a buyer yit?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>“Naw!” Pipe Smash said disgustedly. “White
folks won’t buy no nigger’s boat, an’ niggers ain’t
got no money.”</p>

<p>“How financial do a nigger got to be to pick up a
good, cheap, han’-me-down boat?” Skeeter asked
cautiously.</p>

<p>“Well, suh, I figger it out dis way,” Pipe Smash
said, boring the middle finger of his right hand into
the palm of his left hand for emphasis. “I bought
dat whole boat jes’ as she floats from a white man
whut picked a fuss wid de cote-house an’ had to
run in a direction whar de river didn’t go. It
costed me two hundred dollars ten year ago, an’ is
some wore out. One hundred dollars in cash
spondulix gits her now.”</p>

<p>Skeeter glanced at the faces of his three friends
and each responded with a slight nod. Skeeter
made a careful advance.</p>

<p>“Ef I jes’ knowed somepin ’bout how to run a
steamboat&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>“Don’t none of you niggers know nothin’ ’bout
steam-engines?” Pipe asked, in a peculiar voice.</p>

<p>“Naw!” they said in a chorus.</p>

<p>A peculiar expression passed over Pipe’s face.</p>

<p>Skeeter’s quick eyes caught the look, and he
rightly concluded that Pipe was going to take
advantage of their ignorance to cheat them.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no trouble to learn how to run ’em,”
Pipe remarked. “All you got to do is to keep fire
in de furnace an’ water in de b’iler, an’ hol’ to de
steerin’-wheel an’ stay in de river.”</p>

<p>“Dat sounds easy,” Skeeter said, as he rose to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
his feet. “Less paddle out an’ take a look at dat
boat.”</p>

<p>When they were all aboard and the engine
was puffing laboriously up the river, Pipe Smash
looked at the four grinning negroes with an air of
triumph.</p>

<p>He knew his steamboat was sold.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were traveling about as fast as a lame
man could walk, but there was an exhilarating
throb to the engine, and a cheerful slap-slap to the
paddle-wheel, and the river went past them instead
of taking them with it, and by shutting their
eyes for five minutes and then opening them they
could see that they were actually gaining on the
scenery.</p>

<p>And the scenery would set an artist wild: a sky
like a soap-bubble, and high in the dome a buzzard
sailing like a speck of dust, a river like a broad,
flowing ribbon of old gold, and close to the levees
on each side the woods, dense, black, moss-hung
and funereal, absorbing so little of the sun’s light
that the negroes could hear the call of the night-owls
and the voice of the whip-poor-will.</p>

<p>Suddenly Skeeter’s high soprano voice ran out
across the water, the other voices joined, and the
woods echoed back the music:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“When peace like a river, attendeth my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When sorrers like sea-billers roll&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whutever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It is well, it is well, wid my soul.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>“Whut is de name of dis boat called, Pipe?”
Skeeter asked at the end of their song.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t got no name,” Pipe answered.</p>

<p>“Dat won’t do,” Vinegar Atts bellowed, as he
looked with proprietary eye upon the vessel.
“Less call her by some high-soundin’ name.”</p>

<p>“Less call her de <i>Skeeter Butts</i>?” the little
barkeeper promptly suggested.</p>

<p>“Naw!” the three other men whooped.</p>

<p>Skeeter giggled.</p>

<p>“I figger dar will be three votes agin any yuther
nigger’s name in dis bunch,” he said. “Less call
her de <i>Hen-Scratch</i>.”</p>

<p>“Naw!” the trio bellowed. “A saloom ain’t
no fitten name fer a boat.”</p>

<p>“Less call her de <i>Shoo-fly</i>.”</p>

<p>“Naw!” the bunch howled. “We don’t name
no boat after a Mefdis meetin’-house.”</p>

<p>Finally Skeeter said:</p>

<p>“I motions dat we leave it to Pipe Smash to
name de boat fer us!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right! Gib us a good name, Pipe!”</p>

<p>Pipe scratched his woolly head and thought.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“Is you niggers made acquaintance wid a coot?”</p>

<p>“Suttinly.”</p>

<p>“Is you ever seed how a coot starts to fly? He
leans fur back like he was restin’ on his tail den
he takes a runnin’ shoot&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shore! We knows!” the men interrupted.</p>

<p>“Dis boat gits its start by shovin’ wid its tail,”
Pipe resumed. “Furthermo’, dis boat, like a coot,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
is a lan’ an’ water bird. Accawdin’ to dat notion,
I votes dat we call dis boat after de nigger word
fer a coot&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“De <i>Mud Hen</i>!” the quartet whooped triumphantly.
“De <i>Mud Hen</i>!”</p>

<p>From that moment our four friends were consumed
with desire to own the boat which had
received such a high-sounding and appropriate
name.</p>

<p>Skeeter presided at a lengthy consultation, then
came forward to the pilot-wheel and counted one
hundred dollars into Pipe Smash’s greedy palm.</p>

<p>“Each of us chips in twenty-five dollars, Pipe,”
Skeeter explained.</p>

<p>“Dat’s a fine way to do,” Pipe grinned. “Is
you elected who is de head boss leader yit?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” Skeeter said. “We ain’t got dat fur.”</p>

<p>“Ef you ’vide up yo’ jobs an’ decide who is
gwine be who, I’ll learn you how to run de boat an’
esplain each man’s job to him,” Pipe proposed.
“Atter dat, I’ll step off.”</p>

<p>“I announces myse’f de captain of dis boat!”
Skeeter Butts yelled. “Any objections?”</p>

<p>“I’s de commondore,” Hitch Diamond bellowed.</p>

<p>“I’s de skipper,” Figger Bush quacked.</p>

<p>“My job is cut out for me,” Vinegar Atts
grinned. “I’s de fust high exalted chaplain.”</p>

<p>“Whut do de chaplain do?” Skeeter Butts
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“He sets down an’ sings religium toons ontil
somebody dies,” Vinegar informed him. “Den
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
he gibs de dead man religium advices, ties a lump
of coal to his foots, an’ draps him in de ribber.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a easy job!” Figger cackled.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so,” Vinegar growled. “Plenty accidunts
happen on boats&mdash;de b’iler busts, de boat
snags out de bottom on a stump an’ sinks, de boat
ketches on fire an’ burns up, an’ niggers falls overboard
an’ gets drowndead.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Revun!” Skeeter Butts barked. “Dat
kind of graveyard talk gibs me trouble in my
mind.”</p>

<p>“Prepare to git ready to die!” Vinegar bellowed
dramatically. “Dis river is ’bout fawty miles
deep!”</p>

<p>“Whut you figger on doin’ as commondore,
Hitch?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>“I sets in de middle of dis boat to balunce de
load,” the giant prize-fighter announced. “I’ll
watch you fiddle wid dat little steer-wheel, an’
between times, mebbe I’ll shovel a leetle coal.”</p>

<p>“Whut you gwine do as skipper, Figger?”
Butts inquired next.</p>

<p>“I skips all de hard jobs, an’ all de easy wuck
dat I kin,” Figger snickered. “I don’t mind
standin’ up in front an’ watchin’ fer snags an’
allergaters. I’s gwine hab a fence rail tied under
each arm an’ stan’ straddle of a log. Ef dis boat
sinks, Figger figgers on floatin’ to land!”</p>

<p>“I’s gwine lay in some fence-rails, too,” Vinegar
Atts declared. “I’ll need a whole wood-pile of
’em.”</p>

<p>“It’ll take a whole log-raft to float me,” Hitch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Diamond decided. “I’ll fix it togedder as soon
as I git back to land.”</p>

<p>“Whut good will a lot of fence-rails do you
niggers ef dis old engine busts?” Pipe Smash inquired
in a tone of comment. “When a steamboat
blows up dar ain’t enough of it left over fer any
fool nigger to set on.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s so,” Skeeter Butts replied uneasily,
trying to grin with stiffening lips. “Does dey
bust up pretty frequent?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, dey never busts up but once,” Pipe
Smash grinned. “Once is a plum’ plenty fer any
kind of boat.”</p>

<p>“I mean does pretty many boats bust up?”
Skeeter explained.</p>

<p>“All of ’em&mdash;soon or late,” Smash chuckled.</p>

<p>“Mebbe I hadn’t oughter been so spry ’bout
buyin’ dis boat,” Skeeter mourned, as he looked
down into the muddy water and shuddered.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t say dat till I learnt how to run de
boat,” Smash responded. “Come here an’ take
holt of dis wheel.”</p>

<p>Smash had shrewdly waited until the right time
to give this invitation. They were now riding
down the middle of the river on the current. The
boat was still lacking in speed, but it moved as
smoothly as a high-powered automobile.</p>

<p>“Huh,” Skeeter chuckled. “Dis here is a
snap. I feel like I been runnin’ steamboats all
my life. Gimme elbow room accawdin’ to my
muscle, niggers, an’ watch Cap’n Skeeter Butts
make de <i>Mud Hen</i> flit!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>Hitch Diamond, the commodore, reached for the
coal shovel.</p>

<p>“Drap dat shovel, Hitch!” Pipe Smash grinned.
“Coal costs a heap money an’ you don’t want to
waste it goin’ down-stream. De time to shovel
ain’t yit.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Hitch agreed. “It ’pears to me
like we is all got a snap. I shore feels comferble.”</p>

<p>“I got a easy job, too!” Vinegar proclaimed.
“’Tain’t no real trouble to set down an’ wait fer
a corp’.”</p>

<p>“All you niggers, come here!” Pipe Smash
exclaimed. “I wants to press somepin’ powerful
heavy on yo’ minds, an’ ef you fergits it offen yo’
minds, I tells you right now dat Revun Atts won’t
wait long to git a fust-rate corp’.”</p>

<p>“Whut’s dat?” Skeeter chattered.</p>

<p>“You see dat contraption up on dat engine
whut looks like a clock?” Pipe Smash asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh!”</p>

<p>“Dat is called de steam-gage. Dat shows how
much steam is in de b’ilers. Now dis engine won’t
tote but sixty pounds of steam an’ be plum’ safe&mdash;you
see dat indicator p’ints to sixty now.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” Hitch Diamond corroborated.</p>

<p>“Whut do us do ef we git over sixty?” Skeeter
asked tremblingly.</p>

<p>“Ef you is puffin’ up-stream, you kin risk sixty-five,”
Pipe Smash told him. “But atter you pass
dat number&mdash;good-night!”</p>

<p>“Dat ain’t tellin’ me whut to do!” Skeeter
snapped.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>Smash scratched his woolly head, loosened his
soiled shirt-collar by running his fingers around
his fat neck, and sighed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whut is did wid dem succumstances,”
Smash declared. “I ain’t never loss
my good sense an’ got up dat high yit. But I got it
figgered out dat a real quick nigger could do two
things: he kin open de furnace, rake out de hot
coals, set de boat on fire an’ burn her up; or, he
kin jump in de river an’ let de boat float ontil she
busts!”</p>

<p>“Hear dem words!” Vinegar Atts bawled. “I
knowed I had a good chance to orate over a corp’!”</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts looked greatly scared for a minute,
then he took a big breath and rallied.</p>

<p>“Dat ain’t so awful dangersome,” he said. “I
bet you niggers seben dollars per each dat dat indicator
don’t never reach sixty no more&mdash;open dat
furnace door, Hitch, an’ cool de b’iler!”</p>

<p>The commodore lost no time in obeying the
captain.</p>

<p>“Dat ain’t de right way to do!” Pipe Smash
told them. “Ef you open de furnace door, de
b’iler gits hotter&mdash;dat makes de fire draw better!”</p>

<p>“Shet dat furnace door, Hitch, you fool!”
Skeeter barked. “My Lawd, you’s gittin’ us
ready to bust!”</p>

<p>The commodore shut the door.</p>

<p>Then Pipe Smash gave them another jolt:</p>

<p>“You all is got one mo’ little jigger to watch,
niggers!” he said, pointing to a glass tube. “Dat
little, round, glass bottle is de water-gage. You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
wanter put water in de b’iler till dat water-gage
stands half-full all de time. Ef dat little bottle
ever goes plum’ dry, de buzzards will be pickin’ yo’
bones outen de top of de cypress trees along dis
river!”</p>

<p>“Hear dat, now!” Vinegar Atts whooped.
“Dis here chaplain shore has cut out a hard-wuckin’
job fer hisse’f!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Revun!” Skeeter snapped. “You
ack like you wus proud dis boat wus gwine bust.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so!” Vinegar protested. “I done
invested my whole June sal’ry from de Shoo-fly
chu’ch in dis boat!”</p>

<p>Skeeter’s eyes lit on Figger Bush.</p>

<p>“Figger,” he said, “you done nominate yo’se’f
de skipper&mdash;you skip aroun’ here an’ sot yo’ eye
on dis glass bottle!”</p>

<p>“She won’t dry up as long as I rides in dis
boat!” Figger said with conviction. “I wouldn’t
take my eye offen dat bottle ef a allergater tickled
me wid his tail!”</p>

<p>“I got a few mo’ advices,” Pipe Smash announced.
“You wants to keep de lily-pads,
snags, an’ wire-grass outen de paddle-wheel an’ de
steerin’-gear. Ef you don’t you’ll git kotch in de
current an’ float plum’ to de Gulf of Mexico.”</p>

<p>“Hear dem words!” Vinegar Atts whooped.
“All you niggers better be on de mourners’ bench
a gittin’ religium!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Vinegar!” Skeeter wailed. “You
set behime dis boat an’ watch dat paddle-wheel.”</p>

<p>“I shore will!” Vinegar declared. “An’ de fust
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
time she fouls up you’ll see Vinegar floatin’ to’des
de shore straddle of his own coat-tail! Dis chaplain
don’t take no chances wid hisse’f&mdash;I don’t need no
visit to de Gulf.”</p>

<p>“I cain’t remember nothin’ mo’ to say,” Pipe
Smash said, scratching his woolly head. “Mebbe
I oughter say dis: Keep all de bolts screwed up
real tight.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s my job!” Skeeter declared. “I don’t
trust dese igernunt niggers wid no monkey-wrench.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, Cap’n!” Pipe Smash applauded.
“You keep dat monkey-wrench in yo’ hand an’
’tend to dat job wid yo’ eyes wide open, or you’ll
shore hab to paddle yo’se’f ashore wid yo’ hands!”</p>

<p>They passed the spot on the shore where, four
hours earlier, the boat had been tied to a stump.</p>

<p>Pipe Smash glanced up at the sun.</p>

<p>“I ’speck it’s ’bout time I wus steppin’ off an’
lettin’ you-alls hab yo’ boat,” he said. “I’s
gwine to de railroad track an’ ketch de log-train
fer Kerlerac. Dar’s a big Fo’th of July nigger
dance at Kerlerac to-night.”</p>

<p>Skeeter ran the boat past the stump, gave the
wheel a turn, the current swept the rear of the boat
around, and Skeeter puffed up to the landing with
the skill of an expert pilot.</p>

<p>“Well did!” Smash applauded, as he leaped
into the canoe and paddled to shore with the line.
“You ack like you been runnin’ steamboats all
yo’ life!”</p>

<p>When the men stood once more upon the ground
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
they shook hands all around and were perfectly
happy.</p>

<p>“Now, fellers,” Skeeter said, “I motions dat
we goes back to Tickfall in de auto, gits us a lot
of grub an’ fixin’s, an’ come right back to de boat
fer a long ride.”</p>

<p>“Ef you’s plannin’ to take a long ride, fellers,
mebbe I could do you a las’ kind favor by tightenin’
up all de machinery,” Pipe Smash said. “I
got a little time yit.”</p>

<p>“De Lawd bless you, my brudder!” Vinegar
Atts howled. “Dat would shore be a Christyum
ack.”</p>

<p>“Be shore an’ watch dat little bolt back behime
de steam-gage, cullud folks,” Smash grinned.
“De jumpin’ of de steam loosens up dat bolt mo’
dan any.”</p>

<p>“You go on an’ tight her up, brudder!” Vinegar
urged. “Put yo’ muscle to it right!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, niggers!” Pipe Smash howled. “You
won’t see me when you come back. I hopes you’ll
like de boat an’ hab good luck!”</p>

<p>As Pipe climbed on the boat the automobile
roared the departure of the happy quartet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two hours later the automobile party returned
to the river.</p>

<p>They unloaded four baskets of food and four
large watermelons. Figger Bush had advocated
bringing a jug, but Skeeter Butts had vetoed the
suggestion on the ground that it might offend the
Reverend Vinegar Atts, chaplain. Skeeter knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
better than that, but he saw no reason why he
should furnish the bunch with a gallon of liquor
when he did not drink himself.</p>

<p>“How we gwine git dis truck to dat boat?”
Hitch Diamond growled, looking across the water
in surprise.</p>

<p>“How did dat Pipe Smash git to land when de
little canoe is tied up agin de side of dat steamboat?”
Figger Bush asked.</p>

<p>“He come in hand over hand on de rope,”
Skeeter Butts informed him. “Pipe knowed ef he
tied dat canoe to de land some nigger would steal
it.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a fack,” Hitch Diamond bellowed.
“’Taint safe to leave nothin’ aroun’ whar a po’
nigger kin set down an’ trabbel in it.”</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts laid hold upon the line and passed
over to the boat swinging by his hands as agile
as a monkey. Then he put to shore in the canoe
and ferried his friends across. Afterward, he
brought in the food supplies.</p>

<p>“We’ll trabbel up de river fust, niggers,” Captain
Skeeter Butts announced, as he and Hitch
Diamond busied themselves with the fire in the
furnace. “Soon as I gits a little practice wid runnin’
her, we’ll turn down stream an’ paddle plum’ to
de Gulf of Mexico.”</p>

<p>As far as they could see, they were the only
living creatures on the river. The noon sun blazed
in the heavens and made the deck of the boat like a
furnace; the heat reflected from the water was
simply dreadful. A white man would have fallen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
with heat prostration in an hour, but these children
of the sun laughed and sang and shouted, and
stood in the blaze of light, grinning, white-toothed,
and perfectly happy.</p>

<p>They ate watermelon, gobbled their lunches,
smoked cheap cigars, and talked like a lot of
gobbling turkeys. Finally Vinegar Atts walked
to the edge of the boat and looked down in the
muddy swirl of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>“Dis water looks heap deeper to me since dat
Pipe Smash went away,” he contemplated. “An’
I bet it’s powerful wet, too!”</p>

<p>“You git a rockin’-chair outen de bood-war an’
set down, Revun!” Captain Butts commanded.
“I don’t wanter hear you startin’ no doubts!”</p>

<p>“Dar ain’t nothin’ in de drawin’-room but a
three-leg stool,” Vinegar mourned. “’Taint got
nothin’ to rest my back agin.”</p>

<p>“Let her go!” Hitch Diamond, the commodore,
bellowed in a voice which could be heard a mile.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts laid one hand upon the wheel and
with the other slightly opened the throttle.</p>

<p>The paddle-wheel spanked the water for three
revolutions, then there was a backward jerk which
loosened every negro’s teeth.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond fell against the furnace door
on his hands and knees. Figger Bush went
crashing against the fragile side of the vessel,
Skeeter Butts draped himself over the pilot-wheel
with a loud squall, and the stool on which
Vinegar Atts sat turned over, upsetting the dignified
chaplain and landing him on his back, where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
he lay bellowing like a cow and waving his hands
and feet toward the blue sky.</p>

<p>Two watermelons and four baskets of grub
rolled overboard followed by Vinegar’s precious
stove-pipe hat, which bobbed up and down on the
water like a diminutive battleship monitor.</p>

<p>The little boat was tugging at the end of her
rope like a lassoed mustang.</p>

<p>“Stop her!” Hitch Diamond, the commodore,
bellowed in a voice which could be heard two miles.
“We fergot to untie de boat from dat stump!”</p>

<p>Skeeter had already stopped the engine, and
the negroes lost no time in releasing the line.</p>

<p>Then started a pow-wow lasting an hour, about
whose business it was to untie the boat. They
finally made Figger Bush the goat, on the ground
that his office of skipper was to skip around and
do everything the others forgot. They abused
him dreadfully for his neglect of duty, and Skeeter
turned his back to the wheel several times while he
delivered a remark which was calculated to reduce
Skipper Bush’s self-esteem to a minimum.</p>

<p>This was a very risky proceeding on the part
of the pilot, especially when the boat was hugging
the shore and navigating the slack water. Skeeter
found it out when the bottom of the boat grated
dully upon some soft substance underneath, and the
boat paddled feebly, emitted a few discouraging
puffs, and stopped.</p>

<p>Then the worm turned, with the venom of a
moccasin snake.</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Figger Bush snarled. “Look
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
whut you done went an’ did! Run us up on a
mud bank!”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</p>

<p class="caption">When the boat stopped.</p></div>

<p>Skeeter reversed the machinery, pulled the
whistle-cord, puffed and snorted, sloshed the
Mississippi about some, developed a thousand
snort-power from his engine, but not enough horse-power
to back off.</p>

<p>In his embarrassment he sweated enough water
to raise the river and float his craft off the mud
bank, if the water could have been applied at the
right place.</p>

<p>The other three negroes took a delight in informing
him in raucous tones what a sublimated
donkey they thought he was.</p>

<p>Figger Bush developed an unusual flow of eloquence,
and finally ended a superb climax by the
proclamation:</p>

<p>“All dem unkind words whut you said I wus
for not untyin’ de boat&mdash;you is dem!”</p>

<p>Then Skeeter had an inspiration.</p>

<p>He handed the end of a rope to Hitch Diamond
and Vinegar Atts, and remarked in an unusually
sweet tone:</p>

<p>“You two cullud pussons please git over on de
shore an’ pull dis boat outen de mud!”</p>

<p>“Naw!” the two men howled. “We ain’t
gwine mess up our clothes!”</p>

<p>“All right!” Skeeter remarked. “I’ll let de
<i>Mud Hen</i> set on her nest till she hatches out a rise
in de river an’ floats off.”</p>

<p>He sat down, lighted a cigarette, fanned himself
with his hat, and inquired:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>“Whar’s dem watermellyums? I feels hongry!”</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy!” Vinegar Atts howled. “Whar
is dem dinner-baskits an’ my stove-pipe preachin’
hat?”</p>

<p>Skeeter arose to his feet with a nonchalant air,
shaded his eyes with his hand and looked far down
the river. A black hat bobbed merrily upon the
waves, followed by four baskets and two watermelons.</p>

<p>A loud wail arose from the stranded boat, the
loudest wail emitted from the throat of Vinegar
at the loss of his precious hat.</p>

<p>“O Lawd!” he mourned. “Dat’s de best
money-collectin’ hat I ever did own. A nigger
would look down in dat black, silk hat an’ drap in
a dollar jes’ to hear it blop!”</p>

<p>“’Twon’t be no trouble to git it back agin ef
you pull us outen de mud,” Skeeter suggested
artfully. “We’ll go on up to de bend, den turn
aroun’ an’ chase our dinner-baskits an’ yo’
hat!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de way to do!” the commodore and
chaplain readily agreed, as they climbed into the
canoe. “We’ll shore pull her off!”</p>

<p>One half hour of herculean effort on the part of
the two men with the tow-line, accompanied by
the steady coughing of the one-lunged steamboat,
and the wailing admonitions of Skeeter and Figger,
and then the boat floated free. Hitch and Vinegar
climbed back on deck, fell exhausted, and lay flat
on their backs looking at the blazing sky above
them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>For two hours more, they paddled up the river
without mishap. Skeeter Butts began to grin.</p>

<p>“I’s ketchin’ on, fellers!” he exclaimed. “I
feels as scrupshus as a blue-jay wid a fresh worm!”</p>

<p>It would have been better for Skeeter, had he
watched what was going on in the river. Just as
he reached the bend, six miles above the Tickfall
landing, there broke upon the still air, two loud,
soul-thrilling whistles, one before them up the
river, the other behind them.</p>

<p>If our friends had been experienced boatmen,
they would have landed when they heard those
two signals, tied their boat, crawled over on the
far side of the levee, and engaged in earnest prayer
for the safety of their craft.</p>

<p>Both boats had whistled for the bend.</p>

<p>One was the <i>Federal</i>, a government tug, which
was forbidden to pass the city of New Orleans at
a speed exceeding twenty miles an hour on account
of the damage done to the shipping and the levees;
the tug-boat was now splitting the Mississippi
River wide open at forty miles an hour, and the
swell of the rollers in its wake lashed the levees
like the breaking of sea-billows on a rock-bound
coast.</p>

<p>The other boat was the big river steamer
<i>Nackitosh</i>, whose wash was known and cursed
by river fishermen and rafters from St. Louis to
the Gulf.</p>

<p>The two boats passed each other in the bend,
and then the <i>Mud Hen</i> found herself in the middle
of the river, which rocked like a storm at sea.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>Skeeter Butts clung desperately to the pilot-wheel,
slapping around it like a dish-rag waving
in the wind; Hitch and Vinegar, who had been
lying flat on their backs on deck, began to roll and
scratch and claw at the deck to keep from falling
overboard into the river; Figger Bush fell into the
coal-pile near the furnace, scrambled like a cat in an
ash-barrel, and kicked lumps of coal all over the
boat.</p>

<p>There is nothing which can roughhouse a little
boat as shamefully as two big boats; from the
government tug there came a fan-shaped stern-wave
four feet high, rode under the <i>Mud Hen</i>,
hoisted her nearly end on end, and let her down.
Then the wash from the side-wheel steamboat
met the tug’s stern-wave, rode over it like a petrel,
and came aboard the <i>Mud Hen</i> for a friendly call
on the new owners.</p>

<p>Four hundred barrels of nice, wet Mississippi
River water sat down in the laps of the terrified
Tickfall quartet and embraced them lovingly.</p>

<p>Then this colored quartet sang a scale of ninety
or one hundred assorted yells never before introduced
in any musical composition. In fact, they
put their souls in their voices with such surprising
effect that it introduced them to sounds from
their throats which they did not know up to that
time they possessed.</p>

<p>The <i>Mud Hen</i> turned completely around three
times, tossed on the current like a match-box, stood
on first one end and then the other, and pretty
nearly straight down.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>The experience was not dangerous, merely exciting;
but the quartet did not know that, and
when at last the river quieted, and they found
themselves still afloat, they regarded it as a miracle
wrought by the mercy of heaven.</p>

<p>It was five minutes before Skeeter Butts could
recover his breath and crawl to the wheel. Five
minutes more passed before he was able to speak
a word. Then in a dry tone&mdash;the only dry thing
about Skeeter&mdash;he said:</p>

<p>“I wus fixin’ to turn aroun’ at de bend, anyhow.
I figger it’s ’bout time we wus gittin’ back to de
automobile.”</p>

<p>The hour’s ride back to the Tickfall landing
was free from conversation. Not even Vinegar
Atts could think up anything to say. Each had
bidden farewell to the world a few minutes before,
and now in a sense of great deliverance, they were
trying to repossess it.</p>

<p>As they approached the landing their courage
slowly revived.</p>

<p>“Dem two boats sot us right behime death’s
door, Skeeter,” Vinegar remarked in a weak
voice.</p>

<p>“It squoze me up some in death’s door,” Skeeter
chattered, slapping at his wet garments. “Dat
expe’unce is done ruint me&mdash;I won’t never be de
same agin.”</p>

<p>“I’se glad it happened,” Hitch Diamond growled.
“It wus a powerful good try-out fer dis boat. I
don’t believe nothing kin sink her now!”</p>

<p>“Ain’t it de trufe!” Figger Bush quacked. “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
ain’t never gwine be skeart on dis <i>Mud Hen</i> no
mo’.”</p>

<p>“You look at dat glass water-tube an’ see is de
b’iler got plenty water in it!” Skeeter barked.
“Mebbe some spilt out when we wus mighty nigh
upsot.”</p>

<p>Figger skipped to the water-gage and grinned
triumphantly.</p>

<p>“She’s all right,” he yelped. “Is you keepin’
yo’ eye on dat ole steam-gage?”</p>

<p>Skeeter was.</p>

<p>In fact, he was gazing at that steam-gage with
hypnotic fascination. He swallowed a succession
of Adam’s apples like a string of smoked sausages
before he could speak.</p>

<p>Skeeter knew precious little about machinery.
Pipe Smash’s solemn and impressive warning
about the steam-gage of the <i>Mud Hen</i> had scared
him. His experience on the river with the two big
boats had fortunately not upset the <i>Mud Hen</i>,
but it had considerably upset Skeeter’s mind and
his judgment. What Skeeter thought he saw
that steam-gage doing is a mechanical impossibility,
but his announcement had a startling
effect.</p>

<p>“Come here, fellers, an’ look at dis steam-gage!”
he wailed. “Dat indicator is done gone plum’
aroun’ de face of dat clock five times an’&mdash;she’s&mdash;gwine&mdash;aroun’&mdash;again!”</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” Vinegar Atts whooped. “Dis
<i>Mud Hen</i> is gittin’ ready to bust! Jump! Jump
fer yo’ lives!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>Four negroes went over the side into the middle
of the river.</p>

<p>The <i>Mud Hen</i>, paddling busily, kept to the current
and moved serenely down the river.</p>

<p>Then, while the four frightened negroes got
the shore, frog-fashion, Pipe Smash climbed out
from his hiding place in front of the engine, and
laid his experienced hand upon the pilot-wheel
of the <i>Mud Hen</i>.</p>

<p>He glanced at the steam-gage, and the indicator
pointed steadily at sixty degrees of steam. Skeeter’s
terrified eyes had played a trick on him!</p>

<p>“Gosh!” Pipe Smash exclaimed with a wicked
grin. “I never had no idear dat steam-gage wus
gwine skeer dem coons. I had a notion dey would
leave dis boat when dey got kotch in de big wash
of de steamboat gwine up de river. I wus plannin’
on dat.”</p>

<p>He stooped and threw a shovelful of coal into
the furnace, and chuckled aloud:</p>

<p>“I fergot to tell Skeeter dat de furnace of dis
engine wus so little dat nobody cain’t git up mo’
dan sixty pounds of steam&mdash;’tain’t no danger of dis
engine bustin’ onless de b’iler runs dry. Excusin’
dat, dis here indicator cain’t slip aroun’ five times
like Skeeter said it done&mdash;after it gits past dat
biggest number on de gage, it hits a peg! I figger
dat Skeeter was skeart!”</p>

<p>Pipe walked to the stem of the boat and shading
his eyes looked up the river to the Tickfall landing.
He waved his hat in the air and whooped, making
more noise than his steamboat whistle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>Standing upon the shore, dripping puddles
from their water-soaked garments, the Tickfall
quartet heard that ironical whoop.</p>

<p>Broken-hearted and disconsolate, they watched
their boat move serenely around the lower bend
and pass out of sight in the gold and purple haze
of the setting sun.</p>

<p>Returning to Tickfall in the automobile, the four
negroes made much talk over the loss of the <i>Mud
Hen</i>.</p>

<p>“We bought dat boat good an’ hones’ wid real
money,” Skeeter mourned. “Pipe Smash stole
it from us.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so,” Vinegar Atts growled. “But it
’pears to me like we left dat boat in de middle of
de river, an’ dat’s jes de same as givin’ it to any
nigger dat’s willin’ to ketch holt.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de way I felt when I left her,” Figger
Bush cackled. “I warn’t needin’ no steamboat
jes’ den. Skeeter said dat steam-gage wus a cuttin’
up! I tuck his word fer it ’thout lookin’.”</p>

<p>“Us, too!” Hitch and Vinegar agreed.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ didn’t ail dat steam-gage,” Skeeter
snapped. “Dat boat didn’t bust-she never
would ’a’ busted. My eyes wus kinder jiggerty
an’ I couldn’t look real good.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t talk that way on de boat,” Vinegar
Atts growled. “I done loss my twenty-five dollars
because you didn’t hab sense enough to watch yo’
bizziness!”</p>

<p>“My hind-sight is always better’n my eye-sight,”
Skeeter Butts replied in piteous accents.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>“I must hab got started wrong end foremost in dis
worl’, for I never sees nothin’ till I gits past it.”</p>

<p>“Stop blimblammin’, niggers!” Commodore
Hitch Diamond ordered. “Mebbe we’ll git back
to Tickfall in time to see de fire-works.”</p>

<p>“Dat reminds my mind!” Skeeter Butts exclaimed.
“Marse Tom Gaitskill tole us to git back
from de river in time to he’p him shoot ’em off!”</p>

<p>The Fourth of July in Tickfall was a Gaitskill
institution.</p>

<p>In the month of May, 1865, Tom Gaitskill returned
to Tickfall in the tattered gray of a Confederate
soldier&mdash;a colonel at nineteen years of
age.</p>

<p>He cast off the past with his worn-out garments,
married a beautiful girl, and started with her,
hand in hand, along the paths of peace.</p>

<p>Two months later, on the Fourth of July, he
dragged the only cannon Tickfall possessed to the
top of the hill in front of his house, invited every
white child and every negro piccaninny to his
home to witness the celebration, and with his
own hands fired one shot from the cannon for
every year of independence in the United States
of America.</p>

<p>As the years passed, the Gaitskill Fourth of
July celebration grew and developed and became a
social institution, until finally, when wealth flowed
in upon Gaitskill in a golden stream, he made it a
practice to entertain the whole population of the
village on that night.</p>

<p>The fiftieth celebration was now in progress.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>On Gaitskill’s spacious lawn in front of his
house, all the white people, men, women, and
children, had assembled; in a large horse-lot by
the side of the house, all the negroes had congregated;
across the street in a large pasture was
an immense accumulation of fire-works.</p>

<p>Fifty years had performed gracious offices for
Tom Gaitskill and his wife. The beauty and
nobility of honorable old age was theirs, as they
stood beside the white colonial columns of their
home and welcomed their guests, white and black.
The two presented a picture which a man sees
once in a lifetime&mdash;then remembers it forever more.</p>

<p>Suddenly “Old Sneezer,” the venerable Tickfall
cannon, boomed!</p>

<p>“Come on, Skeeter!” Hitch Diamond growled.
“We better go over in de pasture an’ he’p de white
folks shoot off de works!”</p>

<p>“Hitch,” Skeeter answered pitifully, “I feels
powerful sick. It ’pears like I cain’t git dat
steamboat offen my mind. You an’ Vinegar an’
Figger go over an’ he’p de white folks an’ let me
set an’ ponder a while.”</p>

<p>“All right!” Hitch growled. “But ef Marse
Tom ketches you cuttin’ out wuck, he’ll kick you
all over dis hoss-lot!”</p>

<p>Old Sneezer boomed again!</p>

<p>Then for two hours the population of Tickfall
sat entranced.</p>

<p>Numberless roman candles shot their balls high
in the air with a graceful curve, countless sky-rockets
burst above their heads in a shower of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
sparks, an artillery fire of bombs burst into stars
over them, cataracts of red, white, and blue fire
flowed in a tumbling stream, horses, bicycles,
automobiles, and whole strings of railroad cars
traveled across the pasture, while through it all
sounded the boom! boom! boom! of old Sneezer,
the cannon, counting the number of years of our
national independence!</p>

<p>In the midst of this celebration, Skeeter Butts
was suddenly galvanized into action by a great
idea. He went racing across the street into the
pasture, and drew Hitch Diamond and Figger
Bush to one side.</p>

<p>“Listen, niggers!” he panted. “Rake off some
of dese here fireworks! Marse Tom is got a heap
mo’ dan he needs! Swipe out a few!”</p>

<p>Following his own suggestion, Skeeter seized a
keg of calcium powder and ran across the pasture,
setting it in the corner of the fence. He was
followed shortly by Hitch Diamond and Figger
Bush, one bringing an unopened package of roman
candles and the other a package of sky-rockets.</p>

<p>“Dat’s plenty of dis kind of truck, fellers!”
Skeeter cackled. “Go back an’ rake off de bigges’
cannon pop-crackers you kin find!”</p>

<p>From that moment Skeeter became an active
assistant in the celebration, and when the old
cannon boomed for the last time and the fire-works
ended with a final set-piece which revealed
the American Flag, twenty feet high and nearly
forty feet long, the populace of Tickfall roared
their hearty approbation to the skies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>Ten minutes later a procession of negroes
marched down the hill from the Gaitskill home,
their glorious, pipe-organ voices chanting the
Battle Hymn of the Republic.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Glory! Glory! Halleluiah!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our God is marching on!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At midnight the marching column of singing
negroes disbanded.</p>

<p>“Vinegar,” Skeeter said, “me an’ Figger an’
Hitch is decided to go to Kerlerac in de automobile
an’ git in on de nigger dance at dat place.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t gwine!” Vinegar answered. “’Tain’t
fitten fer a nigger preacher to dance. Excusin’
dat, I’s too fat an’ de women folks step on my
foots.”</p>

<p>“You got to go!” Skeeter wailed. “You got
to he’p Hitch Diamond push de auto through de
sand!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Vinegar acceded. “You can’t
trabbel nowhere widout my muscle. I’ll tag along
wid you-alls!”</p>

<p>When they got to the automobile Vinegar found
certain mysterious bundles piled up in the machine.</p>

<p>“Whut is dis?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Fire-works!” Skeeter snickered. “We raked
off a few so we could go to Kerlerac an’ surprise
dem niggers!”</p>

<p>“I’s glad I’s gwine!” Vinegar chuckled. “I
bet us will hab plenty big doin’s!”</p>

<p>Three hours later Skeeter stopped his machine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
at the foot of the Mississippi protection levee at
Kerlerac. The town was asleep. There were no
electric lights and the river fog concealed the
stars, making total darkness.</p>

<p>“Vinegar,” Skeeter said, “does you still mourn
de loss of dat stove-pipe preachin’ hat whut you
drapped in de river to-day?”</p>

<p>“I suttinly do!” Vinegar growled.</p>

<p>“Would you wish to earn another good silk hat
by a little wuck?” Skeeter inquired next.</p>

<p>“Shorely.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make you a present of a ten-dollar silk
hat, white silk linin’ on de inside an’ slick, shiny
fur on de outside wid a red silk handkercher to
slick it up wid, ef you’ll take my auto back to
Tickfall to-night an’ meet me at de Tickfall landin’
on de river to-morrow mawnin’,” Skeeter Butts
said.</p>

<p>“Whut&mdash;whut&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t ax no ’terrogations!” Skeeter snapped.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” Vinegar howled.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond lifted out the bundles, and
Vinegar sat down at the wheel, turned the machine,
and roared his farewell to the men.</p>

<p>Picking up the bundles, Skeeter led his friends
down the levee for a short distance, stopping when
he saw a black shape on the water.</p>

<p>Taking an electric flashlight from his pocket,
Skeeter sent the glare across to the bulky object
looming in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Look at dat!” Hitch Diamond growled.
“Dar’s our boat! Dat’s shore de <i>Mud Hen</i>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>Skeeter reflected the light upon the water beside
the boat until it rested upon a canoe.</p>

<p>“Pipe Smash is on dat boat now!” Figger Bush
whispered. “I bet he got drunk at de nigger
dance an’ is sound asleep!”</p>

<p>“Now, fellers,” Skeeter began, “you listen to
me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Skeeter talked like a grape-juice orator for five
minutes, and his audience of two listened with
breathless attention.</p>

<p>After that Skeeter went aboard the boat,
climbing the rope hand over hand, and paddled
the canoe back for his bundles and his friends.</p>

<p>Pipe Smash lay in a drunken slumber on the
deck with his head toward the warm furnace of
the engine.</p>

<p>Skeeter untied the boat from a stump, paddled
to the <i>Mud Hen</i>, climbed aboard, and let the
steamboat drift slowly out into the current.</p>

<p>When they had floated about two miles below
Kerlerac, where the heavy woods lay upon each
side of the river, Skeeter crawled upon his hands
and knees, and from the keg which he had stolen
from Gaitskill laid a heavy trail of calcium powder
all around the boat.</p>

<p>Hitch opened the furnace door and laid twenty-four
large sky-rockets on the hot ashes, and left
the door open.</p>

<p>Figger Bush opened a package of roman-candles,
scooped up a shovel of live coals from the furnace,
and laid it beside the package.</p>

<p>Skeeter lighted the fuses of half a dozen immense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
cannon-crackers and dropped them carelessly
near the sleeping form of Pipe Smash.</p>

<p>Then the three hid themselves where they could
see without being seen.</p>

<p>The cannon-crackers exploded with a detonation
which reverberated from the immense woods,
shook every piece of wood in the fragile boat, and
sounded like a little war.</p>

<p>Pipe Smash awoke from his deep dream of peace
with a loud yelp. He sat up and rubbed his eyes,
wondering what had happened.</p>

<p>Instantly a trail of red fire, started by Skeeter
Butts, changing to blue, yellow, green, and white,
spun like a flaming snake around the deck of the
boat, and Pipe Smash lay back on the deck, whirling
over and over like a worm on a hot griddle,
whooping like a siren.</p>

<p>From out of the furnace door twenty-four skyrockets
roared, shot out over Pipe’s head, struck
the deck with a hiss changing to a loud screech,
ricochetted around the boat, and burst into ten
thousand stars against the puny smoke-stack and
the fragile roof.</p>

<p>In a split second Pipe Smash was as crazy as a
bug with fright.</p>

<p>He spun around that boat-deck like a cat in a
fit, squalled and spat and screeched and scratched,
rolled and tumbled, jumped to his feet and kicked,
fell flat on his back, rolled over, crawled on all
fours, and performed every stunt within the range
of physical activity.</p>

<p>To his terrified vision, the <i>Mud Hen</i> was aglow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
with fire, the dense woods along the river were
ablaze, the water was a glowing coal-ember, and
the river fog twisted and turned and folded back
upon itself and became great glowing blankets
of flame. Earth and sky and water were wrapped
in one horrible red conflagration, while from every
part of the boat the tongues of flame leaped out,
licking at his cringing flesh!</p>

<p>Pipe Smash shrieked and went over the side.</p>

<p>Keeping carefully concealed, Skeeter, Hitch,
and Figger seized their roman-candles, lighted
them by thrusting them in the hot embers in the
shovel, and peppered the water around the
struggling, shrieking, diving, choking, swimming
negro as far as they could see him.</p>

<p>Then Skeeter dropped a live coal into the keg
of calcium powder, and the boat was enveloped
in a red glow of smoke and fire.</p>

<p>Running through the deep woods on the bank
of the river, Pipe Smash glanced behind him and
saw his steamboat blazing to the heavens, and
bade it good-by forever.</p>

<p>Then followed darkness and great silence while
the <i>Mud Hen</i> drifted on the current.</p>

<p>Early that morning, as the <i>Mud Hen</i>, in the proud
possession of her rightful owners, clucked noisily up
to the Tickfall landing, the reverent Vinegar Atts
climbed out of the automobile, stood up on the
levee, belled his gorilla-like hands around his mouth,
and in true orthodox, camp-meeting tones, gave the
negro’s universal shout of happiness and victory:</p>

<p>“Bless Gawd!”

<h3>I<br />

“ALL DE WORL’ AM SAD AN’ DREARY.”</h3>

<p>Mustard Prophet, overseer of the Nigger-Heel
plantation, sat on a box under a horse-shed in
the rear of the Gaitskill store.</p>

<p>The gathering dusk of the October evening lent
beauty to his sordid surroundings, and Mustard
sweetened the scene by music. His thick lips
caressed the silver mouthpiece of a cornet, and his
bellows-like lungs sent forth strains which made all
Tickfall listen:</p>

<p>“All de worl’ am sad an’ dreary, eb’rywhar I
roam&mdash;”</p>

<p>Wherever music is there the negroes are gathered
together. In a moment Pap Curtain entered the
lot.</p>

<p>He was welcome because he carried a trombone.</p>

<p>“How come you toot sich sad toons, Mustard?”
Pap inquired as he took his own musical instrument
out of a dirty green bag.</p>

<p>“Ain’t us all sons of sorrer, Pap?” Mustard
demanded in an argumentative tone. “Fo’ hundred
bales of cotton raised on de Nigger-Heel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
plantation by me&mdash;an’ how much does me an’
Marse Tom git fer it? Jes’ perzackly nothin’ an’
not no more.”</p>

<p>“De white folks is argufyin’ ’bout a buy-a-bale
move,” Pap began.</p>

<p>“Huh,” Mustard snorted. “Me an’ Marse
Tom is argufyin’ ’bout a sell-a-bale move. I come
to town to cornverse him ’bout dat.”</p>

<p>Pap’s trombone was ready, and the conversation
ended with the lively strains of a duet, the refrain
of which was: “De nigger hoes de cotton an’ cawn,
but de white man gits de money.”</p>

<p>At the far end of the town a black saddle-horse
emerged from the shadows of the swamp road and
sailed up the sandy street with a motion as steady
and rhythmical as the flight of a bird.</p>

<p>Balanced on the pommel of his saddle, the rider
held a heavy canvas bag filled with gold and silver
coins, but so easy was the gait of that superb horse
that not a coin rattled. From long habit the
animal stopped in front of the Tickfall bank.</p>

<p>The rider dismounted and walked to the door,
feeling in his pocket for his keys.</p>

<p>Failing to find his keys, he set the bag of money
on the steps and began a search of his clothes, but
without success. After a moment’s thought he
remounted his horse and rode down the street to
his store.</p>

<p>The closing hour was six o’clock, and as it was
nearly an hour later than that, he found the store
also locked. But he stopped at the home of one
of his clerks and secured a key.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>Entering the building, he opened a small iron
safe in the office situated in the middle of the
store, placed the bag of money within, and gave
the combination-knob a few quick turns.</p>

<p>Then hearing the lively duet in the rear of the
store, he passed out into the lot. The duet came
to a quick close.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Marse Tom?” the negroes exclaimed
in concert. Then Mustard Prophet added, “I
been waitin’ fer you all dis Saddy atternoon.”</p>

<p>“I knew it was you, Mustard,” Gaitskill grinned.
“I’ve been hearing the sound of that old cornet
twenty years, and I’d recognize it in China.
What’s aching now?”</p>

<p>“Marse Tom, ain’t dese here hard times?
Ain’t money skeercer dan snow in a hot biscuit-pan?”</p>

<p>“Just so,” Gaitskill said. “I’ve been out
collecting to-day, and I know.”</p>

<p>“I reckin you an’ me will hab to keep on trustin’
de Lawd, Marse Tom&mdash;yes, suh, as de old Injun
useter say, trus’ de good Lawd an’ keep our cotton
dry.”</p>

<p>“What did you want to see me about?” Gaitskill
asked.</p>

<p>“Look at dese clothes, Marse Tom!” Mustard
answered earnestly. “Look at dese here empty
pockets! Ain’t dey no way to sell our cotton?
Don’t I git no loose change fer my year’s hard
wuck?”</p>

<p>“Trust the good Lord!” Gaitskill grinned
mockingly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p>“I’m is trus’ de good Lawd, Marse Tom, but
dat ain’t git me nothin’. An’ I’m jes’ ’bleeged to
tell you, Marse Tom, dat while I still trus’ de Lawd
I’s lookin’ to <i>you</i> fer some good clothes an’ some
money.”</p>

<p>“Put not your trust in princes,” Gaitskill said
with solemn mockery. “Trust the Lord!”</p>

<p>The negro fumbled at the keys of his cornet
and sighed.</p>

<p>Gaitskill watched him with twinkling eyes.
He was the best plow hand, the best hoe hand, the
best negro overseer in Louisiana, and for twenty
years had been in charge of Gaitskill’s famous
Nigger-Heel plantation.</p>

<p>Simple, confiding, good-natured, trustworthy,
industrious, Gaitskill was very fond of him and
would do anything in reason for him. He loved to
point him out to his friends as the negro whose
hard work had made the Nigger-Heel one of the
show-places among the plantations of the state.</p>

<p>“We’ll talk about it to-morrow, Mustard,”
Gaitskill proposed. “What are you going to do
to-night?”</p>

<p>“Hopey’s lookin’ fer me up to yo’ house, Marse
Tom,” Mustard declared, all his gloom gone. “I
ain’t saw dat wife of mine sence all dis here war
trouble come on me.”</p>

<p>“I want you to sleep in this store to-night,”
Gaitskill said. “Pile up some of the empty oat-sacks
in the rear of the store and make a bed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. I’ll take keer of eve’ything. You
knows me, Marse Tom. Gimme de key!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>Gaitskill passed over the door-key and the negro
followed him through the store to his horse.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom,” he said, as Gaitskill was mounting
his horse, “’bout dis here war in Yurope; I
don’t see no signs of no war in Yurope. Now, I
figgers it out dis way: de Yanks up Nawf is done
bought up all de newspapers an’ dey’s skeerin’ us
wid all dis war-talk so dey kin run de price of cotton
down an’ all us pore niggers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aw, shut up!” Gaitskill said.</p>

<p>Mustard watched the horseman until the dust
and dark swallowed him up far down the street.
Then he turned back into the store with a grin:</p>

<p>“Dat white man ain’t onsottlin’ his mind ’bout
no war. He owns a bank!”</p>

<p>Mustard locked the front door, shutting himself
in, then passed through the rear door into the lot
where Pap Curtain was still waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Pap,” Mustard began, “does you know how
come a nigger wucks wid his hands, while the white
man figgers and counts his money?”</p>

<p>“Naw.”</p>

<p>“Well, suh, hit happened this way: A nigger, a
Injun, an’ a white man wus playin’ seben-up under
de shade of a tree. De good Lawd dropped down a
box of tools right close to whar dey wus settin’,
an’ all of ’em hopped up to git whut wus comin’
to ’em. De nigger wus hoggish an’ he grabbed de
bigges’ things, an’ he got a shovel, a hoe, an’ a spade.
De Injun, he had to hab his’n, so he grabbed de
bow ’n’ arrer. Dar warn’t nothin’ lef’ fer de white
man but a pen, so de white man, he figgers!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s whut de good Book say. But
I’s heerd tell it diffunt.”</p>

<p>“How’s dat?” Mustard asked.</p>

<p>“De good Lawd made a nigger, a white man, an’
a Injun outen good clean mud. Atter de dirt had
dried real good, He fotch ’em befo’ de big white
jedgment seat.</p>

<p>“He say to de white man: ’Whut you gwine
do?’ De white man specify: ‘I’s gwine be a merchant.’
Den He say to de Injun: ‘Whut you
gwine do?’ De Injun spoke Him back: ‘I’se gwine
hunt and fish.’</p>

<p>“Den He say to de nigger: ‘What you gwine do,
cullud pusson?’ De nigger, he claw his head an’
’spon’: ‘Dunno, boss. I reckin I’ll jes’ foller atter
de boys. Mebbe dar’ll be cold vittles lef’ over fer
me!’”</p>

<p>“Dat’s shore a true sayin’, Pap,” Mustard
grinned. “An’ dat reminds my mind. Marse
Tom didn’t say nothin’ ’bout me gittin’ my supper
nowhar.”</p>

<p>“White folks cain’t turn a dog in a meat-house
or a nigger in a sto’-house an’ especk him to starve
to death,” Pap suggested.</p>

<p>“An’ of co’se, white folks cain’t be mad ef de dog
or de nigger gives a invite to his frien’,” Mustard
grinned. “Come in, Pap, less git somepin to eat!”</p>

<p>In the rear of the store they switched on an
electric light, set out an empty box to serve for a
table, and began a search for food. There was
plenty of it, and they helped themselves and each
other with extravagant liberality.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>For a long time utterance was impeded by food,
but at last Pap Curtain managed to articulate a
query:</p>

<p>“Mustard, wid all dis grub in dis ration-house,
how come ole Miss Mildred Gaitskill is so skinny
an’ Marse Tom ain’t no fatter dan he wus when we
fust knowed him fawty year ago?”</p>

<p>“Fattenin’ hogs ain’t in luck,” Mustard told
him philosophically. “When you gits all you
wants to eat, look out for de butcher! Escusin’
dat, white folks ain’t studyin’ ’bout somepin to
eat. Dey studies money.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” Pap sighed, as he rubbed his stomach,
then rose and walked around the store to make
room for more food. “I wouldn’t mind a invite
to hold dis fer a <i>constant</i> job&mdash;plenty of steady
sleep an’ reg’lar rations.”</p>

<p>“I’s got to whar I kin still chaw, but I cain’t
swaller much mo’,” Mustard lamented. “Less
hunt somepin kinder loose an’ little to eat, so it’ll
fill up de cracks inside us!”</p>

<p>The hours passed.</p>

<p>At last Mustard leaned back in his chair. His
stomach was gorged, his head blood-flushed until
his temples throbbed like drums. He kicked over
the box which had served as a table, thus dumping
the cans and bottles and other empty receptacles
into a corner of the store and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Whar is de seegaws in dis sto’?” Pap inquired
sleepily.</p>

<p>“I’ll git ’em,” Mustard said.</p>

<p>Selecting the largest cigars in stock, he wandered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
sleepily back to Pap Curtain. The clock in
the court-house steeple tolled the hour. Mustard
counted.</p>

<p>“Twelve!” he exclaimed. “Here we been eatin’
five hours an’ to-morrer is de secont day! Git
outen dis sto’, Pap Curtain!”</p>

<p>Pap rose, and Mustard followed him to the rear
door and shut him out.</p>

<p>Then, tossing his cigar aside, Mustard piled an
armload of sacks in the corner, snapped off the
electric light, and sprawled down upon his pallet,
sinking instantly into a slumber like the lethargy
of the gorged boa constrictor, or the inertia of the
hibernating bear.</p>

<p>He was a sound sleeper.</p>

THE LONE WOLF.</h3>

<p>Slatey the Skull was a gentleman of leisure
and perverted education; he was also a nitroglycerin
expert, making a specialty of the application
of this sovereign explosive to burglar-proof
safes.</p>

<p>He was a child of the congested cities, loving the
noise and clatter of their streets, the whir of machinery,
the hum and hustle of their myriad life.
But tuberculosis clutched at his panting, crumbling
lungs with the pitiless fingers of death, and the
ravages of the disease had changed a naturally
ruddy countenance into the emaciated, soapstone-colored
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
face which gave him the name among his
fellows.</p>

<p>Under sentence of death, imposed, not by the
law of the land which he defied, but by the law of
life which defied him, he had wandered from the
city to the deep woods and sparsely populated
villages of the South as a wild goat leaves its
fellows and crawls into some desolate mountain
cave to languish and die alone.</p>

<p>Despairing of his own life, indifferent to the lives
of others, he was a lone wolf, perilous, predaceous,
as quick to strike and as deadly as a viper. His
admiring fellows said of him that he could “smell
money.”</p>

<p>Slipping like a shadow from the log-train which
stopped for water at Tickfall shortly after midnight,
he wandered up the crooked, silent, deserted
streets toward the business portion of the
village.</p>

<p>Pausing before the door of the Gaitskill store,
his thin, flexible nostrils quivered like a rabbit’s
nose. Flattening himself against the door like the
wraith of a man, his keen eyes searched the streets,
his acutely sensitive ears listened intently.</p>

<p>Then he turned, and with an ease like the magic
of a sleight-of-hand performer, he opened the door
and entered the store.</p>

<p>“I smell a nigger,” he muttered with a curse, as
the stale odor of cigar smoke racked his frail body
with noiseless coughing.</p>

<p>Leaving the front door unlocked, he walked
noiselessly down the avenue between the counters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
to open the door in the rear. There he found
Mustard Prophet sleeping on a pile of sacks,
invisible to the eye, but easily vizualized by the
trained mind of the Skull as he listened to Mustard’s
stertorous breathing.</p>

<p>“A nigger,” he racked with his noiseless cough,
“stuffed like a fat woman’s stocking, sleeping like
a stiff!”</p>

<p>He walked back to the little office partitioned off
in the middle of the store. His frail fingers
fumbled with the combination knob of the safe for
a moment, then caressed its top and sides.</p>

<p>“Forty years old,” he sighed, “and made of
pot-metal. If I was not so weak, I’d turn it over
and kick a hole in the bottom of it with my sore
toe. As it is, I’ll have to work with this soup and
cough like an alligator for a week with its fumes in
my lungs.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the door of the safe swung
crazily open, hanging upon a half-broken hinge.</p>

<p>The bony arm and hand of the Skull explored
the contents. His fingers grasped the top of the
coarse bag which Colonel Gaitskill had placed
there a few hours before, and he lifted it out.</p>

<p>“No further seek its contents to disclose or draw
its dollars from their frail abode,” the Skull
parodied. “The simp put it all in one sack for me
and tied the top with a rawhide string.”</p>

<p>His fingers fumbled the contents of the sack
through the thick cloth.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” he sighed. “Gold and silver and a
little dirty paper money&mdash;heavy as pig-iron&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
I’m too weak to carry an empty pill-box across the
street to a homeopathic doctor.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he took the bag with him as he
started to leave. At the rear door, he paused at
the pallet where Mustard lay sprawled out and a
sardonic smile distorted his skull-like face.</p>

<p>“Behold the guardian of this gold!” he muttered.
“Strange the South has been the fall guy for this
sort of servant ever since the South began. Well,
Cæsar had his Brutus, and every colonel has his
coon!”</p>

<p>Then he stepped out into the lot and closed the
door behind him.</p>

<p>There was the crack of a pistol, and a bullet
plugged into the door-jamb.</p>

<p>“You missed, friend!” the Skull called tauntingly.
“I had my sharp edge turned toward
you!”</p>

<p>The night prowler in the Southern village seeking
spoils is exposed to no danger by the night
watchman sleeping sweetly on a soft stone step.
The yeggman dreads the fox-hunters.</p>

<p>They leave town at sundown accompanied by
friends, followed by dogs, comforted by the contents
of sundry jugs. They are kept keyed up to
alert wakefulness by the excitement of the chase
and return only when the jugs are empty.</p>

<p>It was a party of fox-hunters, headed by Sheriff
Flournoy, with whom Slatey the Skull had now to
deal. Passing through the town on their return
from the hunt they had heard the dull explosion
in the store and had made an investigation. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
were now in ambush, waiting for the appearance of
the safe-blower.</p>

<p>It was Flournoy’s pistol which had roused the
Skull to his danger.</p>

<p>But the Skull was not disturbed. Shifting his
bag of money so that he carried it on his left arm as
a woman carries a bundle, he slipped his automatic
from his pocket.</p>

<p>Crouching low in the darkness and walking with
the noiseless tread of a cat within ten feet of Flournoy,
he passed unobserved by the sheriff out of
the lot into the alley and on to the front of the
store. The bullets zipped around him as he ran
out of the alley toward the middle of the street, but
the Skull’s first shot was upward at the electric
street light which went out, leaving him sheltered
by almost total darkness.</p>

<p>Running down the alley, Flournoy fired into
that circle of darkness at a venture.</p>

<p>The answer of the Skull’s gun was instantaneous.
The sheriff felt a jar which almost paralyzed his
right arm. Making an investigation he uttered a
low exclamation of wonder and admiration: The
Skull’s bullet had struck and destroyed the sheriff’s
weapon.</p>

<p>In the mean time the rest of the fox-hunters
had been spreading out, trailing along the street in
front of the store. In a moment half a dozen
pistols began to shoot and the Skull was engaged
in the battle of his life.</p>

<p>In the Louisiana villages promiscuous shooting
upon the street at night is a fire-alarm. Roused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
by such shooting, men quickly slip on their clothes,
seize their own firearms, and run down the street
toward the first alarm, firing into the air as they
run, thus rousing the whole town.</p>

<p>All over Tickfall, men heard what they thought
was a fire-signal from the business section of the
village. Fearful of losing their stores and offices,
they ran toward the fray, shouting and shooting,
until Tickfall sounded like a battle with a thousand
men engaged.</p>

<p>“The beggars are coming to town,” Slatey the
Skull quoted with a skinny smile. “I’ll wait until
the mob arrives, then slip through the crowd in the
dark.”</p>

<p>But alas, the Skull was not acquainted with
Sheriff Flournoy.</p>

<p>Adopting the old Indian trick of lying flat on the
ground, thus throwing the object he was approaching
against the sky so that he could see it, the
sheriff with bones like an ox and a mouth as grim
and cruel as a bear-trap was slowly crawling toward
the sardonic creature of skin and bones, as frail
and delicate as a girl, who sat sedately beside the
stolen money-bag.</p>

<p>Suddenly Slatey screamed like a wildcat and
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>Wrestling with his feeble strength, shooting
wildly, biting, clawing, he struggled in the bear-like
hug of the giant sheriff. Then something snapped
inside the Skull’s body and with a frightened
“Ah!” he sank limply into the hands of his captor.</p>

<p>At that moment the street was filled with armed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
men, white and black, looking for the conflagration.
Explanations flew from lip to lip. Some
one entered the Gaitskill store and turned on the
lights.</p>

<p>Then Sheriff Flournoy entered carrying Slatey
the Skull.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” the crowd asked in one breath.</p>

<p>“I think not,” the sheriff said. “I did not
shoot.”</p>

<p>“Gib him a leetle dram, Mister Johnnie,” Pap
Curtain spoke up.</p>

<p>“Go over to my office and get my flask, Pap,”
the sheriff commanded, as he tossed Curtain his
office keys, “You’ll find it on my desk.”</p>

<p>Pap Curtain started after that flask at full speed.
In the middle of the street, under the broken electric
light, his foot struck a coarse canvas bag, he
stumbled, fell headlong, butted a hitching post
with a resounding whack and stayed right there.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the crowd found him, unconscious,
clutching the office keys in his cold hand.</p>

<p>One negro, a belated arrival, saw Pap Curtain
fall.</p>

<p>He ran to Pap’s rescue, but never arrived. His
foot also struck that bag. Stooping, he picked it
up, felt of its contents, recognized the familiar
rattle of coins, and promptly departed, taking that
bag with him lest some other person fall over it
and get hurt.</p>

<p>The sheriff had no sooner sent Pap Curtain after
a flask than several were produced and tendered.
The liquor, poured down the throat of Slatey,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
started a shudderlike cough and a bloody spume
issued from the wounded man’s mouth. Then he
spoke splutteringly:</p>

<p>“You broke a rib and caved it through the only
good lung I have, Mr. Officer. I guess you win.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the money?” Flournoy demanded.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;ah&mdash;” A shuddering, racking cough stopped
all speech and the pitiful creature struggled
as if he were never to breathe again. At last he
spoke:</p>

<p>“I’m suffering very much. Get a doctor&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Where’s the money?” several men asked in a
chorus.</p>

<p>“That’s for you to find out,” the Skull answered,
with a momentary flash of his old lawless spirit.
Then weakly: “Get a doctor!”</p>

<p>“Where’s the money?” Colonel Gaitskill asked,
bending over Slatey.</p>

<p>“Where’s the sawbones, Santa Claus?” Slatey
mocked, coughing little flecks of blood off his lips.</p>

<p>“Get a doctor!” Gaitskill commanded sharply,
glaring at the crowd.</p>

<p>Dr. Shuttle stepped forth, producing, with an
important air, a pocket medical case containing a
hypodermic needle and several vials of medicine.</p>

<p>Dr. Shuttle was young and very ambitious. He
quickly made a hypodermic injection into the
Skull’s side. It eased the criminal’s pain. In fact
he has never suffered since. In short, he died.</p>

<p>“Where’s the money?” the sheriff demanded
again, shaking the lifeless form.</p>

<p>The Skull’s mouth drooped open in a grotesque
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
imitation of a laugh. Slatey had nothing more to
say.</p>

<p>“Thunderation!” the sheriff exclaimed in a
mighty voice. “Hunt around for that money-bag.
This fellow did not get away with it.”</p>

<p>Oil lanterns were quickly procured and the
crowd searched the street, the alley, the lot in the
rear and the neighboring places. They discovered
nothing but the limp form of Pap Curtain.</p>

<p>While the crowd was gathering around Curtain,
from inside the store a mighty shout arose:</p>

<p>“Here’s the other one, Flournoy!”</p>

<p>The crowd plunged into the store, surged to the
rear and gathered in a tight circle around the
prostrate form of Mustard Prophet.</p>

<p>He was still asleep!</p>

<h3>III<br />

THE SLEEPER WAKES.</h3>

<p>A number of eager feet kicked Mustard Prophet
into wakefulness.</p>

<p>As many willing hands assisted him to his feet.
He stood among them, glaring owlishly, blinded
by the light, confused by the noise, frightened by
the unaccountable presence of most of the male
inhabitants of Tickfall.</p>

<p>“’Scuse me, white folks,” he began. “I shore
is befuddled-up by all dis here gwines-on. Marse
Tom say fer me not to let nobody in dis here
sto’-house.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>“Where’s that money?” a voice demanded.</p>

<p>“Which?” Mustard asked.</p>

<p>“Where’s that money you and the white man
got?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got no money, white folks,” Mustard
declared. “You-all ax Marse Tom! An’ Marse
Tom say me not to let nobody in dis sto’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aw, come off!” another voice exclaimed.
“You ain’t been sleeping through all this racket.
Tell us where the bag of money is!”</p>

<p>“Befo’ Gawd, white folks!” Mustard replied.
“I ain’t got no bag of nothin’.”</p>

<p>Then Mustard saw Colonel Gaitskill. “Bless
gracious, Marse Tom!” he pleaded. “Come here
and fotch me away from dese pesticatin’ white
gemmans. Dey examinates me ’bout money like I
done sold all de Nigger-Heel cotton ’thout turnin’
in de tickets&mdash;”</p>

<p>Colonel Gaitskill whispered to Flournoy.</p>

<p>“Put him in jail, John, and after the crowd
disperses, we’ll slip around there and talk to him.”</p>

<p>Flournoy promptly acted upon this suggestion,
and on the way picked up Pap Curtain, now
restored to consciousness&mdash;Dr. Shuttle had had
better luck with Pap&mdash;and incarcerated them both.</p>

<p>The crowd followed and watched the sheriff until
he locked the two negroes behind the bars.</p>

<p>“Nothing more doing to-night, friends,” he
announced in his drawly voice. “We’ll all go to
bed and discuss the matter to-morrow. Good-night.”</p>

<p>He walked down the street toward his home.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
The crowd gathered in little groups, talked for a
few minutes and dissolved.</p>

<p>Colonel Gaitskill returned to the store, issued
orders to his clerks concerning the disposition of
the Skull’s body, and went home.</p>

<p>Just at daybreak Sunday morning, Gaitskill and
Flournoy, after another fruitless search for the
lost money, entered the jail.</p>

<p>They found Mustard and Pap Curtain sitting
side by side, steeped in deepest gloom. Gaitskill
became the spokesman:</p>

<p>“Where were you all last night, Mustard?”</p>

<p>“I wus in de sto’-house, Marse Tom. I didn’t
leave dat place a minute till de white folks tuck me
to jail.”</p>

<p>“What did you do after I left?”</p>

<p>“At de fust offstartin’, I et.”</p>

<p>“What did you eat?” Gaitskill asked, wondering
what food could produce slumber as profound
as Mustard seemed to have experienced.</p>

<p>“I et two cans of sawdines, an’ a can of devilish
ham, an’ a hunk of cheese.”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“I et some crackers an’ some beelony sausage,
an’ two awanges, an’ fo’ bananers, an’ a box of
candy.”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ else, Marse Tom. Of co’se, I kinder
nibbled aroun’ a little. I foun’ some raisins an’ a
diffunt kind of cheese whut smelt like somepin
dead to me, an’ some cakes wid white icin’ on de
top, an’ a can of oystyers.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<p>“Did you get enough to satisfy your appetite?”</p>

<p>“Satisfy&mdash;oh, yes, suh, I felt powerful well
fed.”</p>

<p>The sheriff broke into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“No use to cackle, Mister Johnnie. I’s tellin’
de trufe. I shore had a plenty.”</p>

<p>“What did you do next?” Gaitskill inquired.</p>

<p>“I fotch out one of dem long Perique seegaws
an’ lit up.”</p>

<p>Both white men had begun to laugh. Mustard
knew there was no harm coming to a negro from
white men with the giggles. So he dismissed his
fears and became expansive in his remarks:</p>

<p>“Dem Perique seegaw stogies ain’t as good as
dey looks, Marse Tom. No man ain’t got a sucker
in his mouf strong enough to make ’em draw, an’
when dey does draw, no man ain’t got no cornstitution
powerful enough to stan’ de smoke.”</p>

<p>“What did you do next, Mustard?”</p>

<p>“I laid down on dem oat-sacks an’ went to
sleep.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill had known Mustard so long that he
could read the negro’s mind like a book. Although
no question had been asked about the
robbery, he was sure that Mustard had nothing
to do with it. Then he began to explain to
Mustard:</p>

<p>“Somebody robbed my store last night, Mustard.”</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy, Marse Tom! Bad luck is shore
kotch you by de forelock. I’s powerful sorry to
hear dem bad news.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>“The man who blew open the safe was killed in
a fight, but we can’t find the bag of money,”
Gaitskill continued.</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Mustard declared with unction.
“Mo’ bad luck! It ’pears like it’s jes’ sorrer piled
on top of sorrer in dis here grief-strucken-down
worl’. I’s shore sorry, Marse Tom&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The reason I wanted you to sleep in that store
was to guard that safe.”</p>

<p>“Hol’ on dar, Marse Tom,” Mustard said,
coming quickly to his own defense. “You didn’t
say me no words ’bout dat safe. All you said
wus: ‘I want you to sleep in dis sto’ to-night.’
Ain’t dat so?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, suh, I done it. I done it fur a fack.
I done jes’ whut you tole me. I sleeped in de
sto’.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” Flournoy chuckled, imitating
the negro’s mode of speech: “Dat’s whut he
done!”</p>

<p>“I’se sorry, Marse Tom,” Mustard said, “but I
ain’t to blame.”</p>

<p>Sheriff Flournoy looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Look here, Tom,” he said. “If we are going
to find the money, we’d better let this sorry son of
sorrow skedaddle. He ain’t got it.”</p>

<p>Mustard showed that he favored the sheriff’s
suggestion by rising to his feet with alacrity.</p>

<p>“Mister Sheriff Johnnie&mdash;” Pap Curtain, who
had been a silent listener, began plaintively.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Pap,” the sheriff interrupted. “You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
can come, too. I can’t keep a nigger in jail for
falling down and bumping his head.”</p>

<p>The four walked out of the jail door together.
At the door Mustard asked:</p>

<p>“Marse Tom, please, suh, dem white gemmans
pestered me so stout las’ night dat I couldn’t git
my hat an’ my cawnet-hawn befo’ dey tuck me to
jail. Will you open de sto’ so I kin git ’em?”</p>

<p>Consenting to this request, Gaitskill opened the
door, and said:</p>

<p>“Go in and get them, Mustard.”</p>

<p>A minute later, within the store, there was a
loud whoop and a wailing cry:</p>

<p>“Oo-oo-ee! Oh, my blessid gracious goodness!
He’p, Marse Tom, fer Gawd’s sake!”</p>

<p>The two white men ran into the store and found
Prophet down upon his knees, hiding the horror
before him by shielding his eyes with his hands,
which was the still form of Slatey the Skull outstretched
upon a cooling-board in the office.</p>

<p>Mustard had found his hat near his pallet of
oat-sacks, but his beloved cornet was on top of a
desk in the office.</p>

<p>“Get up, Mustard,” Gaitskill commanded,
striking him with his foot. “This is the man who
blew open the safe.”</p>

<p>The big-hearted, giant-bodied sheriff gazed upon
the criminal, then stepped over and felt the
emaciated hands and arms.</p>

<p>“He was as frail as a girl, Tom,” he said, with a
note of pity in his voice. “But he fought like a
snake. I simply had to crush him.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>“Oh, lawdymussy, take me away from dis here
terr’ble place!” Mustard bawled, kneeling before
the broken office safe as before an altar.</p>

<p>Handing the negro his cornet, Gaitskill made
him rise, and followed him to the door, where Pap
Curtain stood pop-eyed and trembling.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom,” Mustard quavered, “I’s gwine
leave dis land of sorrer. I ain’t never comin’ back
no mo’ escusin’ you come atter me an’ fotch me
back.”</p>

<p>“Me, too!” Pap Curtain piped.</p>

<p>The two white men watched the progress of the
two negroes as they hastened down the street.</p>

<p>“Mustard didn’t have a thing to do with it,”
Flournoy said.</p>

<p>Gaitskill nodded his assent.</p>

<h3>IV<br />

THE CONQUEST OF KERLERAC</h3>

<p>“Marse Tom say I warn’t to blame and Sheriff
Flournoy turned me loose. But dem white gemmans
whut kicked me an’ blimblammed me in de
sto’house las’ night ain’t say <i>nothin’</i>. Mebbe
dey’s gwine hang me yit. I dunno. I ain’t
gwine be aroun’ handy till dey gits deir minds
sottled dat they <i>ain’t</i>,” Mustard Prophet declared.</p>

<p>“Ef dey finds out dat you and me wus bofe in
dat house stuffin’ ourse’ves wid vittles, dey’ll take
a notion dat dey <i>am</i>,” Pap Curtain asserted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>“I’s done heerd de call of de migrashun nigger,
Pap,” Mustard said mournfully.</p>

<p>“Go wid me to my cabin an’ lemme git my
trombone-hawn,” Pap replied. “Den I’ll mosey
wid you.”</p>

<p>The two spent the day under the willows on the
banks of the Dorfoche Bayou, lamenting their
luck.</p>

<p>“Pap,” Mustard said, “de good Book say dat
troubles is seasoning. Pussimmons ain’t good
till dey’s fros’-bit. But it ’pears to me like I done
had my sheer of sorrer.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” Pap agreed. “Now I argufies dat
de only fitten occupation for a sorrowful man is
fishin’. Less go ketch some grasshoppers and see
kin we land a few trouts.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Mustard said. “But I favors
fishin’ to’rds de railroad bridge, because we’s gwine
ketch de souf-boun’ freight.”</p>

<p>Just at dark, the whistle of the freight train
screeched for the Dorfoche crossing. Mustard
and Pap tossed their poles into the middle of the
stream and ten minutes later were aboard an empty
freight car, nursing their musical instruments in
their laps, bound for an unknown destination.</p>

<p>The fact that the side door of the car which
they had caught was open would have published
to an experienced traveler that that particular car
was not going very far.</p>

<p>When Mustard and Pap woke up, they thought
at first that the train had stopped.</p>

<p>Then peeping out cautiously, they ascertained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
that the engine had sidetracked their car and gone
on. Finding themselves in the middle of an
immense sugar plantation, they climbed on top of
the car to reconnoiter.</p>

<p>Their first familiar sight was a broad, muddy
river.</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Pap exulted. “Dat’s ole Massasap.
Home’s up de ribber.”</p>

<p>“I bet dis here plantation ain’t fur from some
town,” Mustard reasoned. “Less hoof it up de
river an’ see kin we find some place whut ain’t so
lonesome.”</p>

<p>Picking up their musical instruments, they
walked to the levee and turned upstream.</p>

<p>“I smells Tickfall,” Mustard muttered, sniffing
the air. “’Tain’t no matter how fur it is, dis river
goes past it.”</p>

<p>“I hopes Tickfall ain’t smellin’ us,” Pap
declared. “I’s got it proned into me dat we made
a good riddunce outen dat place.”</p>

<p>Two miles up the levee and around a bend in the
river, they came to a little town squatting like a
bullfrog under the protection levee, its gutters
running constantly with the seepage water from
the dike, its few houses clothed in river fog and
standing on high foundations like stilts, the paint
upon them cracking and their eaves dripping with
moisture.</p>

<p>“Dis here town looks like a spindle-shanked
crane,” Mustard declared in disgust. “Dem
legs under dem houses is shore fixed fer wadin’.”</p>

<p>Then a prominent building came into view,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
and Pap Curtain stopped like a man turned to
stone.</p>

<p>“I knows dis here town,” Pap declared. “Dey
calls it Kerlerac.”</p>

<p>“How fur from Tickfall?” Mustard inquired.</p>

<p>“Thuty mile.”</p>

<p>“Come on, den. Less meet deir ’quaintance.”</p>

<p>“Naw, <i>suh</i>!” Pap protested. “You see dat high
buildin’ over dar? Two nigger womans helt me
up in front of dat Red El’phunt s’loon an’ robbed
me of a dollar an’ fo’ bits. One of ’em helt a razor
at my neck, an’ de yuther tuck my loose change.”</p>

<p>“Dat don’t make no diffunce,” argued Mustard.
“Dey ain’t dar now.”</p>

<p>“I reckin not!” Pap said positively. “I kotch
’em when dey wusn’t lookin’ and helt ’em by deir
hair and bumped deir heads togedder! An’
what you reckin dem womans done? Dey paid a
white lawyer my own good money to git me in a
lawsuit wid de cote-house, an’ dey put me in de
chain-gang fer six mont’s.”</p>

<p>“Hear dat, now!” Mustard exclaimed. “Bad
luck!”</p>

<p>“Shore wus. But I didn’t stay dar no time. I
lef’ dat chain-gang in fo’ days. Dat’s how come
I ain’t so glad to see dis town agin,” Pap said.
Then after a moment’s thought, he suggested: “I
tells you how to do, Mustard. You take yo’
cawnet-hawn an’ go out an’ pick de town.”</p>

<p>“Pick it?”</p>

<p>“Stop on all de cornders, play ’em a toon, den
pass de hat,” Pap explained. “I’ll set down here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
an’ res’ my mind till you gits a little money, an’
in de nex’ town we goes to I’ll do de pickin’.”</p>

<p>So Mustard walked up the levee toward the
town alone.</p>

<p>In the Red Elephant saloon, he said to the bartender:</p>

<p>“Mister, dese here white genmans need wakin’
up dis mawnin’. Lemme toot a toon or two?”</p>

<p>“Crack away, nigger.”</p>

<p>A few experimental strains issued from the cornet,
followed by a high, piercing note; then Mustard
started the music of a song everywhere dear to the
heart of the Mississippi River negro:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, honey, when you hear dat roan mule whicker;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you see Mr. Sun turnin’ pale an’ gittin’ sicker<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Den it’s time fer to handle dis job a little quicker<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ef you wanter git a smell of de boss-man’s jug of licker.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Git up an’ move aroun’! Set dem han’s to swingin’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Befo’ de boss-man comes aroun’ a dangin’ an’ a dingin’.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Git up an’ shout aloud! Let de white folks hear you singin’&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hey! O&mdash;Hi&mdash;O! Hear dem voices ringin’!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All the morning in various sections of the town
Pap Curtain, hiding under the levee, could hear
the strains of Mustard’s cornet.</p>

<p>Just at noon, Mustard came back, walking
slowly, his good-natured face burdened with grief
and disappointment, his defeat and dejection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
revealed even by the dragging of his ponderous
feet.</p>

<p>“Whut ails you, Mustard?” Pap inquired solicitously.</p>

<p>“I’m a son of sorrer, Pap,” Mustard wailed.
“Nobody but de good Marster kin ’preciate what
bad luck I’s had.”</p>

<p>“Whut come to pass?” Pap inquired with interest.</p>

<p>“At de fust offstartin’ I blowed my hawn in de
Red El’phant till de white folks gimme a dollar,
all in nickles and dimes. Den a white man follered
me out when I lef’ an’ tole me ef I would loant him
dat money he would show me how to make it
disappear.</p>

<p>“Of co’se, I loant it to him, an’ he put it in his
pocket an’ said escuse him a minute, an’ he went
away an’ I ain’t seed dat white man sence dat
time.”</p>

<p>Pap Curtain gazed at Mustard with an expression
of mingled pity and disgust. Mustard continued
his tale of woe:</p>

<p>“Two white kunnels gimme fo’ bits apiece to
play <i>Dixie</i> fer ’em. I had dat money changed
over to a paper dollar so it wouldn’t roll away like
de yuther dollar done. Den anodder white man
come along an’ say ef I gib him dat paper dollar
he’d show me how to double it.</p>

<p>“Of co’se, I needed it doubled right quick because
I wus already behine one dollar, so I loant
it to him to double it. He jes’ folded it over one
time; den he shet one eye at me an’ stuck my dollar
down in his pocket.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<p>“Didn’t you ax him to give it back?” Curtain
asked.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, dat was a powerful brave-lookin’
man an’ he acted like he mought ’a’ fought a sawmill
ef he wus peeved up.”</p>

<p>“Mustard, you is a plum’, nachel-bawn, stark-naked
fool,” Pap informed him.</p>

<p>“I agrees wid dem sentiments,” Mustard said
sorrowfully. “Lawdy, my foots shore hurts me
scandalous. Lemme set down.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you got no money a-tall?” Pap inquired
peevishly.</p>

<p>“Naw,” Mustard informed him.</p>

<p>“Is you had anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” Mustard lamented. “An’ I’s so hungry
I could eat a houn’-dog biled in soap grease.”</p>

<p>The two sat for a moment, looking out at the
river. Then Mustard suggested:</p>

<p>“You go out an’ try ’em a few toons, Pap. I
axed eve’ybody I met ef dey knowed a nigger
named you, an’ dey said dey didn’t.”</p>

<h3>V<br />

TROUBLE’S TWIN.</h3>

<p>All the afternoon Pap Curtain played trombone
solos on the streets of Kerlerac while Mustard
Prophet rested his feet.</p>

<p>About four o’clock Mustard and Pap slipped
into a negro eating-house and ordered food.</p>

<p>“Whar you cullud pussons come from?” Smart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
Durret, the negro restaurant keeper, inquired as
his patrons consumed large quantities of fried catfish.</p>

<p>“We stays at Tickfall,” Mustard answered.</p>

<p>“When did you-alls arrive down?”</p>

<p>“We come dis mawnin’,” Pap responded.</p>

<p>At this point another occupant of the restaurant
rose from a table in one corner of the room, gesticulated
mysteriously and forcibly to Smart Durret
and went out of a rear door into the kitchen. The
mulatto proprietor followed.</p>

<p>“Don’t ax so many questions, Smart,” was the
prompt advice of the little negro to the mulatto.
“I wucks fer Sheriff Ulloa, an’ I heard tell dis
mawnin’ dat somebody robbed a sto’ in Tickfall
an’ dey’s offered a hunderd-dollar reward-bill fer
who done it.”</p>

<p>Smart Durret’s mud-colored eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>“Dat sto’ was robbed Saddy night,” the little
negro continued. “Dem two coons come to town
dis mawnin’ early. Dey been takin’ turns hidin’
on de yuther side of de levee all day. Dem niggers
is shore it.”</p>

<p>“Is you gwine tell de sheriff, Solly?” the mulatto
asked.</p>

<p>“Naw,” Solly exclaimed in disgusted tones. “I
figgers dat you an’ me kin kotch ’em out alone,
arrest ’em ourse’ves an’ ’vide up de reward-bill
even.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de music!” Smart exclaimed, admiringly.
“You keep track of ’em an’ you an’ me’ll
git togedder on it to-night.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>Thus advised, Solly Saddler, amateur detective,
shadowed Mustard Prophet and Pap Curtain all
the afternoon and when darkness came was prepared
to report their location to Smart Durret.</p>

<p>“Now, Solly,” Smart advised, “we ain’t got no
permit to ’rest dese niggers accawdin’ to de law.
So I argufies dat de best way to do is to git in a
fight wid ’em, sen’ somebody fer de cornstable, an’
let him tote us all to jail. Den we kin esplain to de
sheriff whut we knows, an’ he’ll let us out because
you’re a frien’ of his’n.”</p>

<p>“Smart,” Solly exclaimed, “when yo’ mind
goes off it kicks like a muzzle-loader. Dat plan’ll
hit de bull’s-eye. But ef you ain’t got no objections,
I’ll be de one whut goes atter de cornstable.
Dem two coons looks powerful perilous
to me.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Smart acquiesced reluctantly.
“But don’t you lose no time gittin’ dat cornstable.
I ’speck you better fetch de sheriff, too.”</p>

<p>They separated to meet an hour later in the
Chicken-Wing saloon, a negro resort where Mustard
and Pap were loudly advertising their presence
by playing duets.</p>

<p>The plan of the two conspirators to start trouble
was simple but effective.</p>

<p>Solly Saddler entered the place with a bucket of
red paint and a broad paint-brush. Smart Durret
came in with a large bottle filled with a foamy,
milk-colored liquid&mdash;soap-suds.</p>

<p>The two avoided each other for a time, then
they got together.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>“Whut’s dat you got in dat bottle, Smart?”
Solly inquired in a nigger-minstrel tone.</p>

<p>“Dis here is a new kind of cleaner fer clothes,”
Smart answered. “It takes all de dirt spots,
grease spots, fade spots, an’ paint spots offen
clothes, suits, dresses, an’ sich like.”</p>

<p>“Dat stuff won’t conjure loose no paint spots,”
Solly argued, flourishing the bucket of paint at
Smart.</p>

<p>“I bet yer fo’ bits,” Smart answered promptly.</p>

<p>Then followed a heated discussion of the merits
of the paint remover. The crowd slowly gathered
around the disputants, and Solly gradually worked
his way around until he stood directly in front of
Mustard Prophet.</p>

<p>Setting the bucket of paint on the floor and
stooping over it, he began to stir it with his brush
while the argument waxed hotter and hotter.
Then Solly arose, with the dripping paint-brush in
his hand.</p>

<p>Then with a quick turn and flourish, he swiped
the dripping paint-brush up and down the front of
Mustard Prophet’s clothes.</p>

<p>“Now, nigger Durret,” Solly bawled dramatically,
“lemme see you take de paint off dis cullud
brudder’s coat!”</p>

<p>Mustard reeled backward to escape the paint, a
guffaw of loud laughter swept around the circle,
and Solly followed Mustard, still busy plying the
brush.</p>

<p>Mustard was a sight.</p>

<p>Then Mustard got busy. Solly felt a hard hand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
on the back of his neck, lost his grip on the brush,
and Mustard caught it.</p>

<p>Irresistibly, Mustard led the struggling negro
back to the red paint, held him there as easily as a
man can hold a wiggling fish suspended from a
hook, and proceeded to paint him red, frescoing
both the garments and the man within them.</p>

<p>Solly bawled and shrieked and struggled and bit,
but Mustard did not release him until the bucket
was exhausted of paint.</p>

<p>Solly, too, was a sight.</p>

<p>Then Smart Durret entered the fracas. Seizing
his bottle of magic cleanser by the neck and manipulating
it like a club, he struck it over the dome
of Prophet’s head.</p>

<p>But the soapy neck of the bottle was slick and
slipped from Durret’s hand, bounced from the
armor-plated skull of Mustard Prophet like a rubber
ball, and was smashed to fragments halfway
across the room.</p>

<p>Pap Curtain, in his turn, came to the aid of his
friend. Picking up the paint-bucket with a circular
motion of his long arm, he brought it down
upon the head of Smart Durret. The bucket did
not bounce, but Durret did.</p>

<p>Deciding it was high time to go for the constable
and the sheriff, Solly departed with expedition,
deeply regretting that the State militia and the
Federal army were not available in this hour of
need.</p>

<p>But Smart and Solly had loyal friends, and in a
moment Mustard and Pap stood with their backs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
to the wall, each in possession of a heavy chair,
holding it like a lion-tamer to keep the crowd from
rushing them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Mustard proceeded to paint him red.</p></div>

<p>“Don’t scrouge, niggers!” Mustard bawled, as
he held his chair poised for battle. “I done kilt
so many coons I can’t count ’em. A feather fell
from a buzzard’s wing an’ hit me on de head when
I wus little, which am a sign dat my path is crossed
wid dead men. Come right on an’ git your’n!”</p>

<p>Then for a minute Mustard and Pap were the
center of a whirling wheel of legs and arms and
hands and heads; holding their chairs before
them they charged through the ring like two
angry bears. Men doubled up before them and
went down and they took a side-swipe at the rest
as they passed.</p>

<p>They had reached the door in safety and were
just about to pass through when the door was
blocked by the portly form of the town constable.</p>

<p>The combatants came to a full stop. The battle
was ended.</p>

<p>“Dat’s dem, Mister Rogers!” Solly Saddler
squealed, as he pointed out Pap and Mustard.
“Dey wus peckin’ on me an’ Smart Durret.”</p>

<p>“You four bucks march along in front of me,”
the officer announced briefly. “Go to jail.”</p>

<p>At the jail door Mustard stopped to make a plea
which was ably seconded by the others.</p>

<p>“Please, boss, don’t put us togedder.”</p>

<p>“Naw,” Solly exclaimed earnestly. “Let me
an’ Smart go upstairs. Lock us away from dem
terr’ble mens!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>“Go upstairs, then,” Rogers said.</p>

<p>A minute later, Pap and Mustard stood together
behind the bars.</p>

<p>“I done been in jail two times in two days,”
Mustard mourned. “Sorrer’s done kotch me
again.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” Pap lamented. “Bad luck’s got me
by de lef’ hind leg wid a downhill pull!”</p>

<p>“Same back at you, brudders!” a strange voice
from the darkness in tragic tones. “I’s Trouble’s
twin!”</p>

<p>Having no charge against the four negroes
except disorderly conduct, the constable had
merely separated the combatants, allowing each
pair the freedom of the entire floor. Mustard
and Pap had believed that they were alone upon
this lower floor until the strange voice spoke.</p>

<p>Their hair stood up in superstitious fear, but
the voice spoke again:</p>

<p>“Howdy, brudders!”</p>

<p>“Who dat talkin’ to hisse’f?” Mustard asked in
frightened tones. “Whar is you at? Name yo’
name!”</p>

<p>“Dey calls me Mobile,” the stranger confessed,
coming forward. Then he proposed in a whisper:
“Less go in one of dese little cages an’ set an’ talk.”</p>

<p>“Naw,” Pap replied forcibly. “De wind might
blow dat iron do’ shet. I likes de outside.”</p>

<p>So, instead, the three groped their way down
the corridor and sat down on the window-sill, using
the grating behind them as a rest for their backs.</p>

<p>“My name is Mustard Prophet.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p>“I’s Pap Curtain.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” was the surprised grunt from Mobile.</p>

<p>“Which?” Pap and Mustard asked in duet.</p>

<p>“Whar you-alls from?” Mobile asked.</p>

<p>“Tickfall.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>“Whut dey got you in fer?” Mobile asked next.</p>

<p>“A nigger painted my clothes in de Chicken-Wing
an’ I fit him to a finish,” Mustard chuckled.
“Pap helped.”</p>

<p>“Oo-ee, brudders!” Mobile exclaimed mournfully.
“I bet dey gives you ’bout fo’teen years fer
dat. Dis is a <i>mean</i> town to niggers! I got to dis
town on Sunday mawnin’, and got drunk, and got
in a rookus in de Chicken-Wing, an’ dey put me in
jail befo’ dinner-time an’ tuck all my money off
me&mdash;an’ I had ’bout fifteen cents!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s too bad,” Mustard sighed, leaning back
against the grating behind him. Then he sprang
forward suddenly and exclaimed: “Looky here,
Mobile! De bars on dis here winder is plum’
loose!”</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Mobile whispered.</p>

<p>“How come?”</p>

<p>“I sawed on ’em all Sunday atternoon, an’ Sunday
night, an’ all to-day, an’ a leetle bit to-night,”
Mobile told him.</p>

<p>“You ain’t figgerin’ to git out, is you?” Mustard
inquired innocently.</p>

<p>“Naw, son!” Mobile denied in tones which
throbbed with disgust. “I jes’ wants to let in a
leetle mo’ fresh air.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>“Us favors mo’ fresh air, too,” Pap snickered.</p>

<p>“I done got ’em sawed loose&mdash;mighty nigh,”
Mobile said. “Dey’s sawed plum’ across on de
sides an’ de bottom, but dey ain’t sawed on de
top. You reckon us-all is got muscle enough to
ketch holt dat gratin’ an’ bend her in or shove her
out?”</p>

<p>“Shorely!” Mustard asserted eagerly. “I kin
heft a bale of cotton an’ tote it up de gang-plank of
a steamboat.”</p>

<p>The three stood up in the window with their feet
resting on the sill.</p>

<p>They stooped and caught hold of the grating at
the lower end, and leaning backward, they lifted
up and in. Under that mighty strain, the iron
grating attached to the masonry by four bars at
the top slowly bent and left an opening underneath
large enough to allow their bodies to pass
through.</p>

<p>The three lost no time in climbing out. They
had gone around to the front of the jail when
Mustard stopped.</p>

<p>“Hol’ on dar, Mobile,” he muttered. “I done
ferget my cawnet-hawn an’ lef’ it in de jail. I
needs dat hawn.”</p>

<p>“Leave it be,” Mobile advised.</p>

<p>“I done fergot my trombone-hawn,” Pap
added. “Go back an’ git ’em fer us, Mustard.”</p>

<p>“Naw,” Mobile protested. “I got plenty
money. I’ll pay you fer ’em.”</p>

<p>“Naw,” Mustard rejoined vehemently. “Marse
Tom gimme dat cawnet-hawn, an’ he’s powerful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
proud of it. He say he’d know de sound of dat
cawnet in Chinee.”</p>

<p>Their argument ended right there, for suddenly
from a window in the second story of the jail two
voices screeched like a calliope:</p>

<p>“Murder-r! He’p! Come here, eve’ybody!”</p>

<p>Yells and whoops and screams and wails came
from Solly and Smart who realized that Mustard
and Pap had escaped and who saw the reward for
their capture slipping away, leaving themselves
in durance.</p>

<p>At the first screech, Rogers, the constable, who
was sitting on a near-by door-step, ran to the
jail and arrived just in time to empty his pistol at
the fleeing forms of the three negroes as they passed
under the last electric street light, and ran onto
the protection levee at the river.</p>

<p>Then the constable hastened back to the jail
and became the recipient of some surprising misinformation
from the wailing negroes in the
prison. In an eager antiphony, they recited what
they knew, snatching the sentences from each
other’s lips:</p>

<p>“Dem two niggers whut got away robbed de sto’
at Tickfall&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“An’ kilt dat Mister Skull whut owned it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“De feller whut blows de cawnet-hawn done
it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He brag his brags dat he done kilt mo’ coons
dan he kin count&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“De monkey-faced tromboner hid behind de
levee all mawnin’&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

<p>“An’ de cawnet-nigger axed eve’ybody did us
know de tromboner befo’ de tromboner would
come out&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ef you ketch ’em agin, Mister Rogers, does us
niggers git de reward bill?”</p>

<p>Mister Rogers, accompanied by the two negroes,
left the jail in a trot and a few minutes later the
constable pounded with his night-stick on the front
door of Sheriff Ulloa’s home, demanding admittance
on most important business.</p>

<h3>VI<br />

IN THE MASSACRE SWAMP.</h3>

<p>“We goes fo’ miles up dis levee to de Massacre
swamp, niggers,” Mobile panted, as he ran.
“Den faller de hog-path two miles to de ole Kerlerac
plantation house. I knows dis country like
I knows de insides of a white man’s hen-coop.
Trot, niggers, trot!”</p>

<p>When the Federal soldiers visited the State of
Louisiana during the Civil War, they carried guns
and ammunition, but they did their best fighting
and won their greatest victories and wrought
their most extensive devastation with water&mdash;muddy
river water.</p>

<p>Invading the State, they cut the levees of the
Red, Atchafalaya, and Mississippi Rivers, and
then let the snows melting on the loyal northern
hills pour their floods and do their destructive
work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p>Because of this method of warfare, Louisiana
was the last State to begin to recover from the
effects of the Civil War.</p>

<p>Her agricultural enterprises absolutely require
the protection of the river levees; prostrated
financially, the State had no money to rebuild
when peace was declared what war had destroyed.</p>

<p>Mobile, followed by Pap Curtain and Mustard
Prophet, was going straight to a spot which indicated
after half a century one of the effects of this
mode of warfare.</p>

<p>The Kerlerac plantation house was a three-story
building erected of stone conveyed, literally,
from the ends of the earth, for the building material
had been brought as ballast in the sailing
vessels which landed with empty bottoms at the
Kerlerac plantation to receive the products of her
soil.</p>

<p>Yearly, during and after the war, the June floods
had swept across that plantation, the water standing
from four to forty feet deep above every inch
of its soil.</p>

<p>The old plantation house, surrounded by its
stately lawns and shaded by its colossal evergreen
oaks, was abandoned, and now after sixty years the
stone ruins stood in the midst of an almost impenetrable
swamp and cypress trees nearly as large
around as a man’s body grew in the center of the
building, their branches protruding above where
the roof had been.</p>

<p>The first gray streaks of dawn showed in the
sky when Mobile led his panting and exhausted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
followers between the walls of this old house and
allowed them a moment’s rest.</p>

<p>“Don’t take too long to blow, brudders!”
Mobile warned them, his own tongue hanging out
like a hot dog’s, his mouth spread wide, showing
a gold front tooth. “Ef de white folks follers us,
dey’ll come right straight to dis here house an’ start
deir hunt from here. I knows ’em!”</p>

<p>“Whut you fetch us here fer, den?” Pap Curtain
inquired indignantly.</p>

<p>“Us niggers is got to hab some money,” Mobile
informed him, “an’ I knows whar a white man has
hid some. Less git it, an’ ’vide up, an’ scoot!”</p>

<p>He walked through the briars and underbrush,
stumbling among the fallen stones, to a certain
corner; then motioning for silence, he listened.</p>

<p>“Dat mought be wind,” he muttered uneasily.
“Den again, it mought be a steamboat puffin’ up
de river. Den, agin, it moughtn’t.”</p>

<p>Raising a large stone, he kicked at the dirt underneath,
then suddenly ceased his operations and
listened.</p>

<p>Then in the dim light his face became ashen,
turning a scar upon his cheek white, and his heart
thumped like a drum. He let the rock fall back
upon the treasure, and motioned to Pap and Mustard
to follow, leading them four times around the
walls and crisscross through the center and then
back to the entrance.</p>

<p>“Listen, niggers!” Mobile chattered. “My
Gawd, listen!”</p>

<p>Far across the swamp they could hear distinctly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
a steady repetition of three short sounds followed
by a long, lowing bellow like a bull: “<i>Ow, ow, ow!
Oo-oo-oo-o!</i>”</p>

<p>“Whut’s dat?” Mustard asked.</p>

<p>“<i>Nigger dogs!</i>” Mobile cried with a voice like a
sob. “<i>Bloodhounds!</i>”</p>

<p>An uncontrollable sobbing seized the negro and
his fright was pitiable. Mustard and Pap, having
no experience with such dogs, looked at him uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>Finally, Mobile dropped to the ground and
listened. Then rising, he announced:</p>

<p>“A whole pack, niggers&mdash;dogs an’ men! We’ll
never git outen dis swamp alive&mdash;dem dam’
dogs’ll gnaw our bones! Come on, less see kin
we make it to de Massacre Bayou!”</p>

<p>They started on a straight line, running side by
side.</p>

<p>Then within a hundred yards they faced a slough
as large as a lake, no one knew how deep with mud
and water. Taking a long detour around this,
they looked back and in two miles of running,
still found themselves in plain sight of the Kerlerac
plantation house.</p>

<p>“Dat’s de las’ big puddle, niggers,” Mobile informed
them. “Now go straight an’ wade eve’ything
you come to!”</p>

<p>The ingenuity of the Spanish inquisition devised
no tortures comparable to the possibilities of pain
arising from a forced flight through a Louisiana
jungle.</p>

<p>A vine trailing the ground for hundreds of yards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
in some mysterious manner wraps three times
around a man’s leg, trips him, and leaves him to
struggle with a bond which he cannot unwrap,
cannot break, and cannot cut with a sharp pocket-knife.</p>

<p>Wild rose vines with thorns like spear-points and
barbed like a fishhook snag the garments and the
skin, and, like Shylock, demand their pound of
flesh. Hidden in every puddle of water, the hard,
sharp cypress knees lie ambushed in the mud like
bayonets to impale anything which falls upon
them.</p>

<p>Overhead, thorn-armed vines and the drooping
branches of the dreadful prickly ash hang down to
retard man’s progress and augument his anguish.</p>

<p>In every damp spot the deadly moccasin lurks;
by every decayed stump and root the venomous
cottonmouth guards its den; insects thrashed up
by the agitation of the grass and weeds rise like an
Egyptian plague and blind the eyes and fill the
nostrils and choke the throat.</p>

<p>And through it all, mud which bogs the runner
to his knees; at every twenty steps a pool of water
and mire, which may be shallow enough for a
sparrow to wade without wetting his feathers, or
as deep as a well; and poison ivy, growing waist
high, saturating man’s garments with its vitriol
juices, and burning the flesh as if the runner were
wading in a caldron of boiling oil!</p>

<p>But the pursuing dog slips unhindered through
the jungle, runs unmired through the mud, swims
the pools of water, and stands howling underneath
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
the tree where the fugitive has climbed to
escape the canine’s tearing teeth.</p>

<p>In half an hour the negroes, scratched, torn,
snagged, wounded, bleeding, mud-covered, half-naked,
looking more like wild beasts than men,
stood on the banks of the Massacre Bayou. Forty
yards behind them a pack of ravening dogs bayed
a red-hot trail.</p>

<p>“Swim it!” Mobile panted. “Git across dis
creek, fer Gawd’s sake!”</p>

<p>They leaped into the stream and dragged their
exhausted bodies up the opposite bank just as the
raging dogs stopped at the water’s edge on the
bank they had just left.</p>

<p>Mobile ran to a hickory sapling as large around
as his arm.</p>

<p>“He’p me break dis off, men,” he screamed.
“We got to fight ’em!”</p>

<p>With the strength of desperation, the three men
wrenched at the sapling, snapped it off at the
roots, broke it in a proper length for a club, and
as quickly as possible selected and prepared two
others like it.</p>

<p>“Look out, niggers!” Mobile howled. “Dey’s
gittin’ ready to swim across! Kill eve’y dog as
quick as his front feet touches the land on dis side.
Whatever happens, git dem big, black, long-eared
debbils fust!”</p>

<p>While he was speaking two of the bloodhounds
leaped from the bank and came toward them,
swerving not an inch before the threatening clubs.</p>

<p>Mobile stepped to the edge of the water and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
stood poised to strike, his crazed eyes glaring at
one of the swimming dogs, the features of his face
quivering with spasms of pain and exhaustion.
Then the hickory descended, and the immense dog
sank under the water with a startled grunt.</p>

<p>Mobile and Pap both ministered to the other
bloodhound which followed its mate to the bottom
of the bayou.</p>

<p>Then the whole pack, deer-dogs, fox-hounds, hog-dogs,
and mongrels, making the swamp hideous
with their howls and yelps, sprang into the stream.</p>

<p>The three negroes ran up and down the bank
of the stream, striking with weary arms, kicking
with feet as heavy as lead, sobbing, praying, cursing,
raving&mdash;adding their insane voices to the
noise of the hounds, making pandemonium of the
silent, shadowy swamp.</p>

<p>At last the hound-pack, wearied by swimming
and unable to effect a landing, turned back to the
opposite shore in defeat.</p>

<p>“Saved!” Mobile sobbed. “Now, niggers, trot
down this here bayou till we git to de public road!”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, they fell in the dust of the
public highway like monstrous worms or rather
like raw, skinned cattle divested of their hides
and their carcasses left as food for the carrion
crows.</p>

<p>For a few minutes they were motionless, lying
like dead men; then a consciousness of approaching
danger roused them to renew their flight.</p>

<p>Rising totteringly to their feet, they breathed
deeply, and started. Then all hope died.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>From out of the high weeds on the side of the
road, a deep-seamed, weather-tanned Spanish face
appeared, and two fearless eyes held the gaze of
the helpless negroes like a hypnotist.</p>

<p>“You niggers stop right there!” a quiet voice
said.</p>

<p>It was Sheriff Ulloa, who knew the route of
fugitive criminals, and had taken the precaution to
guard the only outlet from the Massacre Swamp.</p>

<p>“Please, suh, boss, save us,” the negroes sobbed
in a chorus.</p>

<p>“All right,” the sheriff said grimly. “Trot
right down the center of this road and go back to
the jail you got out of.”</p>

<h3>VII<br />

“GON’ER GIT THEM NIGGERS!”</h3>

<p>Just at noon the three negroes stumbled through
the door of the jail, and like men walking in their
sleep, obeyed the command of the sheriff and
climbed the steps to the second story. There
they fell to the floor and sank into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>The sheriff closed the jail door and sat down
on the steps in front, where he gave himself up to
most serious thought. Almost an hour later he
arose, reëntered the jail, and returning to his
three prisoners picked out Mobile Boone and
kicked him into wakefulness.</p>

<p>“Get up, Mobile,” he commanded. “Follow
me downstairs.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p>Dumbly, the negro obeyed. On the ground
floor the sheriff stopped and spoke:</p>

<p>“Mobile, what are you in here for?”</p>

<p>“I got drunk in de Chicken-Wing an’ tried to
claw a nigger’s nose off.”</p>

<p>“Were you arrested with those other two
negroes?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh. Dey fetch me to de calaboose
on Sunday mawnin’ an’ dem two coons come in
late Sunday night. I never seed ary one of ’em
befo’.”</p>

<p>“If I let you out will you leave town right
away?”</p>

<p>“Bless gracious, boss,” Mobile exclaimed with
most obvious sincerity, “ef you lets me outen
dis jail, I’ll put dis town so fur behine me back
dat it’ll cost you ninety-seben dollars to send me
a postich card.”</p>

<p>The sheriff laughed.</p>

<p>“I means it, boss,” Mobile assured him. “Jes
gimme a shirt an’ a pair of britches so I won’t look
like I was jes’ bawned, an’ I’ll shore ax you good-by!”</p>

<p>The sheriff led the negro across to the office in
the court-house, opened a closet, pawed over some
old hunting clothes, and found some suitable garments
for Mobile. When the negro had put them
on, the sheriff handed him a silver dollar and said:</p>

<p>“Now, Mobile, I’ve let you out because the
chances are those other two negroes are going to be
mobbed. You are innocent and I don’t want to
see you strung up. You’d better hit the grit!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>Mobile did. He went down the levee at a gait
which bid fair to carry him very far in a brief time&mdash;if
he could keep it up.</p>

<p>Then the sheriff returned to the jail and sat
down in the same place.</p>

<p>The town of Kerlerac was deserted except for
the women and children. Practically every male
inhabitant had joined the most exciting of all
chases&mdash;the man-hunt.</p>

<p>The sheriff placed a cigar in his mouth, chewed
it almost to the other end without lighting it, then
spat it out.</p>

<p>“When that searching party finds their dead
dogs and drinks up all their red liquor,” he reasoned
to himself, “and come back to town and find
those coons in jail, they’ll form a mob. My
deputies will desert the crowd when the mob forms,
but they won’t join me. It’s up to me to protect
the coons.”</p>

<p>The town-clock struck two.</p>

<p>Far down the road, Sheriff Ulloa heard the
piercing yell of the fox-hunter.</p>

<p>“They’re coming back,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Taking a large pistol from the holster under his
arm, he examined it carefully, revolving the cylinder
between his thumb and finger.</p>

<p>A tiny chameleon was playing up and down the
bark of a tree twenty feet distant.</p>

<p>With a motion which appeared almost careless,
Ulloa made a turn of his wrist, there was a loud
explosion from the gun, and the little creature
spattered into fragments, leaving a dark, wet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
spot against the tree which looked as if a man
had spat at a hole in the bark and made a center
shot.</p>

<p>The shot aroused the two negroes on the floor
above, and the man-hunters heard it and hastened
back to town.</p>

<p>When the party arrived in Kerlerac they quickly
heard of the sheriff’s capture of the fugitives, but
not a man came to the sheriff to ask him about the
capture. They gathered in a body in the Red
Elephant saloon.</p>

<p>Soon one of the deputies, white-faced and panting,
ran into the sheriff’s presence with the news
that a mob was forming on the outskirts of the
town.</p>

<p>“I expected that,” Ulloa answered quietly.
“You and the other two deputies arm yourselves
with rifles and hide in the tower of the court-house
overlooking the front of the jail.”</p>

<p>“What must we do?” the deputy asked tremulously.
“Shoot?”</p>

<p>“Do your duty!” Ulloa replied shortly, “whatever
you conceive it to be.”</p>

<p>He turned and entered the jail, locking the door
behind him.</p>

<p>“Boss,” Mustard Prophet called down to him,
“me an’ Pap lef’ our toot-hawns down-stairs.
Please, suh, fotch us up de cawnet an’ de trombone!”</p>

<p>With a grim smile the sheriff complied with the
request.</p>

<p>“You niggers better play the <i>Dead March in</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
<i>Saul</i>,” he muttered grimly. “It’ll be appropriate
all right.”</p>

<p>“Us ain’t ’quainted wid dat toon,” Pap grinned,
reaching for his trombone. “But me an’ Mustard
kin shore fetch ragtime and religion songs.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, in the far end of the town, sixty
excited men had supplied themselves with enough
rope to hang a man from a not too distant star;
had armed themselves with knives and hatchets
and axes, with guns and pistols; had appointed
their leader, Barto Skaggs, a man of swarthy
complexion, a grim mouth, surmounted by a
black mustache, and intense, glowing black eyes,
which pressed hard against the lids and showed a
great deal of white beneath the pupil&mdash;the eyes of
the wanton destroyer.</p>

<p>“Keep together, men!” Barto Skaggs advised.
“When one man acts everybody act with him.
Come on!”</p>

<p>With the first forward step of the mob a tall,
gangling, half-wit boy, with a long neck, a step-ladder
head, a long sharp nose, and a receding chin,
and a loose-lipped mouth which dribbled tobacco-juice
as he spoke, began to repeat like a chant:</p>

<p>“Gon’er git them niggers! Gon’er git them
niggers! Gon’er git them niggers!”</p>

<p>His harsh, crackly, gosling voice, uttering every
word with a jerk, soon took the monotonous roll of
a snaredrum. Unconsciously the men kept step
to the words and the purpose expressed in the
sentence was burned into the very fiber of their
souls:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<p>“Gon’er git them niggers! Gon’er git them
niggers! Gon’er git them niggers!”</p>

<p>Turning into the street which led to the jail two
blocks away, the mob rounded the Confederate
Circle, in the center of which was a ridiculous,
stump-legged, pewter image of a man, too short
in its stride for glory, but, nevertheless, erected
by a grateful populace as a monument of glory to
commemorate the heroes of the South.</p>

<p>Then Sheriff Ulloa stepped out of the jail, locked
the door behind him, tossed the key as far as he
could throw it into some high weeds growing at
the side of the prison, and waited.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for the leader and spokesman
to explain to the officer of the law the purpose
of their visit.</p>

<p>Fully a block away the half-wit’s strident voice,
having gained in volume by the constant repetition
of the phrase, conveyed the message in tones which
crackled like thorns under a pot:</p>

<p>“Gon’er git them niggers! Gon’er git them
niggers! Gon’er git&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The mob halted.</p>

<p>“Turn around and go back, gentlemen,” the
sheriff said courteously. “Start your one-man
band to playing another tune, and go back!”</p>

<p>In the center of the street there was a rut which
had been made by wagon wheels.</p>

<p>The mob moved slowly forward, and stopped
at this rut like children toeing a mark in a spelling-match.
They seemed to feel that a contest was
on, and that this rut was the dead-line.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>“We want them niggers, sheriff,” Barto Skaggs
said.</p>

<p>“You shall not have them,” Ulloa replied
quietly and forcibly. “When you kill those blacks
every man of you is a murderer. I shall not be
sheriff of a parish which contains sixty murderers&mdash;men
of prominence&mdash;running at large!”</p>

<p>“Aw, come off, George!” an impatient voice
exclaimed. “You’ve kilt a plenty of coons in
your day!”</p>

<p>“Yes, gentlemen, I have,” Ulloa answered
quickly. “<i>I have never been slow to kill!</i> And I
was elected sheriff of this parish <i>by you</i> for the
one purpose of totally abolishing this wholesale
slaughter of innocent and unoffending blacks,
and for the protection of offenders from mob violence
in order that the law might take its course.
I shall do it.”</p>

<p>Looking into the quiet, determined face of the
officer, the mob wavered. Then the half-wit’s
snare-drum voice rallied them:</p>

<p>“Gon’er git them niggers! Gon’er git them
niggers! Gon’er git&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The mob took one cautious step forward. Ulloa
drew his pistol from his pocket.</p>

<p>“That’s far enough, fellow citizens,” he said,
and now his voice drawled like the purr of a cat
and was deadly in its menace. “When you get
those niggers I won’t be the sheriff of this parish.
I’ll be dead. I don’t know who’ll get me, but I’ll
kill the first man who takes the next step forward!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<p>The mob packed denser, became tense, throbbed
like an automobile when the power is turned on.
Ulloa’s eyes gazed straight into the destructive
orbs of Barto Skaggs and held him like a hypnotist.
Then the half-wit began:</p>

<p>“Gon’er git&mdash;them niggers! Gon’er git&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A back-handed blow from Barto Skaggs’s fist
struck the half-wit fairly in the mouth and sent
him reeling backward, disarranging for a moment
the tense compact mass of men.</p>

<p>Then from the second-story front window of the
jail, just above the sheriff’s head and behind him,
there came a sound which caused the sheriff’s
swarthy face to whiten to the eyebrows&mdash;the
most unfortunate thing which could have happened
to his cause:</p>

<p>“Oo-oh! My Gawd, my Gawd! De mobbers
is comin’! De mobbers!”</p>

<p>Instantly the mob crouched like panthers ready
to spring.</p>

<h3>VIII<br />

MOB AND MUSIC.</h3>

<p>Up to the moment when their frightened screams
had stirred afresh the mob’s lust to kill, Mustard
and Pap Curtain had been totally ignorant of what
was occurring outside the jail. Wandering idly
to the window to look out, they had seen what
every negro dreads, whatever the reason for his
incarceration&mdash;a mob.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>With the first frightened cry Sheriff Ulloa knew
that it would be impossible to disperse the crowd
before him. The scream of the quarry only
stimulates the pursuit of the wolf-pack.</p>

<p>For two dreadful minutes the negroes sobbed
and prayed; then Mustard Prophet turned shudderingly
away from the window and, going to a
window on the side of the jail, knelt at the casement
and wept like a child, looking up now and
then with fear-crazed eyes at the silent statue of
the pewter hero of the Lost Cause.</p>

<p>Then while the grim sheriff stood poised and
ready, fronting alone the crouching crowd of eager
men, the shrill note of an automobile horn was
heard and an immense machine whirled around the
Confederate Circle and came sailing down the
street toward the jail.</p>

<p>One block distant it stopped&mdash;abruptly.</p>

<p>The white-haired, white-bearded man at the
steering-wheel gazed down the street in surprise.
The scene was too familiar to require explanation.
Leaping from the car, he walked slowly and cautiously
down the street.</p>

<p>Then, up in the second story of the jail, Mustard
Prophet leaped to his feet sobbing, praying, shrieking
in a perfect frenzy of hope and fear.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Lawd!” he exclaimed. “<i>Dar’s Marse
Tom!</i>”</p>

<p>Grabbing his cornet like a drowning man
clutches at a straw, he placed it to his quivering
lips. Loud and clear, throbbing with the eagerness
of hope, the courage of despair, the strains of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
music became almost articulate speaking the words
of a song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All de world am sad and dreary,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Eberywhere I roam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far from de old folks at home!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The god Mars, who had witnessed many warlike
scenes in Louisiana, never beheld an incident
so grotesquely dramatic as this.</p>

<p>In front of the jail, grim, white-faced, desperate,
determined to end his life right there, and perfectly
sure that the end was near, stood Sheriff Ulloa.
In the middle of the street, a mob, bloodthirsty
and cruel, listening raveningly to the frightened
screams of their quarry, and eager for the kill.
Up the street, a man serenely observant, apparently
indifferent to what was transpiring before his
very eyes; while within the jail two strangling,
fear-choked negroes whose breath was like the exhaust
of an engine and whose hearts beat in their
breasts like war-drums, sobbed and screamed and
prayed and one of them played on a cornet <i>Old
Folks at Home</i>!</p>

<p>Not since the poor, pitiful, dissipated author of
that sweet folk-song stumbled over the ragged
carpet in his miserable room in the Bowery, struck
his head against his broken water-pitcher, bled to
death upon the floor, and was carried to his grave
while his friends sang his favorite song, had these
words and their music been associated with so
dramatic an event.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p>“Fer Gawd’s sake, Pap!” Mustard sobbed.
“Come here an’ he’p me play dis toon! Don’t
you see Marse Tom standin’ on dat cornder?
Play, nigger, play! Say yo’ prayers in dat hawn
when you toot it!”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All up and down de whole creation<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sadly I roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still longing for de old plantation<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And for de old folks at home!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Up the street the white-haired man listened,
then took off his hat and scratched his head in a
quandary.</p>

<p>“A mob set to music!” he smiled to himself.
“This is something new to me. I wonder what
that fool Mustard Prophet is doing here?”</p>

<p>He walked quietly down the street and stopped
in front of the jail, taking his position by the side
of Sheriff Ulloa. With a graceful gesture he removed
his hat and thus fronted the mob, serene,
powerful, his fine face glowing like an alabaster
vase with a lamp in it, the wind tossing his snow-white
hair and beard&mdash;the most striking and
impressive figure one beholds in a lifetime. He
stood with bowed head listening to the music:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from de old folks at home!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The music ended and the intense silence was
broken by a voice in the mob:</p>

<p>“<i>Aw, hell!</i> I move we adjourn&mdash;<i>back’ards!</i>”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>With a concerted movement like a piece of oiled
machinery, the mob turned and tramped up the
street like a drove of mules, leaving four lengthy
coils of rope, a broken hatchet, a hoe-handle, and a
corncob pipe in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>Turning with gracious Spanish courtesy, Sheriff
Ulloa bowed low before the serene, powerful presence
of Gaitskill, and murmured:</p>

<p>“I thank you. You saved my life!”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort!” Gaitskill snorted. “A
mob can’t work to the tune of Suwanee River!
Where’s that fool who’s blowing that horn?”</p>

<p>“I’ll conduct you to him,” Ulloa answered.</p>

<p>A minute later Gaitskill and Ulloa had secured
another key to the jail, had entered, and stood
in the presence of Mustard Prophet and Pap Curtain.
The two negroes were too overcome to
speak. Crazed by their horrible experiences, they
sat wildly mumbling their prayers and uttering
exclamations of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“These are the men I telephoned you about,”
Ulloa said.</p>

<p>“These are not the men we want,” Gaitskill
replied in a disappointed tone. “One of these
darkies is the overseer on my Nigger-Heel plantation.”</p>

<p>“You asked me over the telephone if one of them
was yellow?” Ulloa said, pointing to Pap Curtain.</p>

<p>“Pap’s yellow, all right,” Gaitskill smiled.
“But he’s not the man. He’s the well-digger of
Tickfall. The coon we want is a nigger named
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
Mobile Boone. He was seen early Sunday morning
coming this way with my bag of money.”</p>

<p>Sheriff Ulloa opened his mouth to speak; then
he closed it without saying a word.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom,” Mustard asked, “wus Mobile a
yeller nigger wid a gold toof in his mouf an’ a scar
on his jaw?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Mustard sprang to his feet with a loud laugh and
gave Pap Curtain a mighty kick.</p>

<p>“Git up, Pap,” he howled. “Less go git Marse
Tom’s money fer him!”</p>

<p>When a moment later the big automobile swung
into the Massacre road leading to the old Kerlerac
plantation house, Pap Curtain leaned over and
whispered:</p>

<p>“Mustard, how you know dat Mobile is hid dat
money under dat rock? S’posen you go dar an’
don’t find it? Whut’ll happen den?”</p>

<p>Mustard turned almost white. Then he answered:</p>

<p>“Pap, ef I don’t git dat money dese here white
men will hang up my Chris’mus socks widout
takin’ me out of ’em!”</p>

<h3>IX<br />

BACK TO THE OLD FOLKS.</h3>

<p>Entering the stone ruins of the old plantation-house,
Mustard walked unerringly to the large,
flat rock which Mobile had lifted a few hours
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
before and raised it from the ground. Pap Curtain
clawed in the soft soil with his horny hands,
then sprang to his feet with a yell.</p>

<p>He held the heavy canvas bag tied with a rawhide
string.</p>

<p>Two hours later, Pap Curtain and Mustard
Prophet, sons of sorrow, reach the pinnacle of
happiness. Clothed in new garments, smoking
cigars, rattling money in their pockets, they sat
down in a banker’s five-thousand-dollar automobile,
the owner at the steering-wheel, and
started their journey back to Tickfall and the old
folks at home.</p>

<p>Mustard Prophet, responsive as mercury to the
least chill in the atmosphere or the slightest increase
in the warmth of fortune’s sunshine, began
to expand:</p>

<p>“Marse Tom, I shore hopes you’ll take better
keer of de rest of yo’ dollars dan you did of dis bag
of money. ’Twus a powerful hard day’s wuck fer
me when I got it back for you!”</p>

<p>No answer from Colonel Gaitskill. The miles
sped by.</p>

<p>Then Mustard asked, with as much curiosity as
if he had been gone thirty years instead of less
than three days:</p>

<p>“Marse Tom, is Hopey livin’ yit?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I bet dat nigger wife of mine makes ’miration
over dese here fine clothes I’m got on.”</p>

<p>Silence again, then a shout from both negroes:</p>

<p>“Bless Gawd! Dar’s Tickfall.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>When the car stopped in front of the bank, Gaitskill
got out, carrying his money-bag, Pap and
Mustard carrying their precious musical instruments.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom,” Mustard inquired, “does I git
my same job at de Nigger-Heel back agin?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“I’s shore glad of dat, Marse Tom. Sheriff
Ulloa offered me a job, but I ain’t gwine take it.”</p>

<p>“What did the sheriff want you to do?” Gaitskill
smiled.</p>

<p>“He axed me to he’p him lay a pipe-line to de
Milky Way so he could start a dairy.”

<p>“Skeeter, whose pup wus dat you wus totin’
aroun’ on yo’ arm yistiddy?” Figger Bush asked
as he sat down beside a table in the Hen-Scratch
saloon. “I’d druther be dead dan be perceived
packin’ a pup.”</p>

<p>“Dat warn’t no common growl-an’-bark dawg,”
Skeeter grinned, blushing until his saddle-colored
face turned to a deep brownish crimson. “Dat
wus one of dese here Spitz dawgs. It b’longs to
Tella Tandy, dat new gal whut jes’ come to Tickfall.
I’s keepin’ it fer her.”</p>

<p>“How come she don’t keep it fer herse’f?”
Figger inquired.</p>

<p>“She’s stayin’ down at Mustard Prophet’s
cabin, an’ she’s skeart Mustard’s fox-houn’s will
eat her dawg up&mdash;dar he comes now!”</p>

<p>The little Pomeranian racked across the sandy
floor of the saloon, small sharp ears erect, his fine
intelligent eyes sparkling, his thick hair as fine and
glossy as silk. He leaped into Skeeter’s lap, and
licked a tiny red tongue at Skeeter’s face.</p>

<p>“Look out, Skeeter!” Figger exclaimed, pushing
his chair out of the danger zone. “Ain’t you
skeart dat Spit dawg will spit in yo’ face?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<p>“Naw!” Skeeter replied disgustedly. “Dey
jes’ calls him a Spitz dawg fer a name. Dat’s a
manner of speakin’, as it were. Ef you buys a
plug of Bull-dawg chawin’ terbaccer, you don’t
especk to git bit, does yer?”</p>

<p>“You shorely muss be stuck on dat new gal ef
you totes her dawg on de street an’ feeds him
puffeckly good vittles in de Hen-Scratch saloom,”
Figger replied, ignoring Skeeter’s question.</p>

<p>“I <i>is</i> in love wid dat gal,” Skeeter replied
positively. “She’s shore easy to look at, Figger.
An’ she specifies she is <i>wuth</i> one thousan’ dollars.”</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” Figger exclaimed fervently. “I’d
be willin’ to tote a whole litter of Spit dawgs fer
her!”</p>

<p>“I wants you to he’p me ketch her, Figger,”
Skeeter said earnestly. “I needs about a thousan’
dollars to make some improvements in dis barroom,
an’ escusin’ dat, de gal is plum’ wuth
havin’.”</p>

<p>“Am she really got dat many money, or do she
jes’ value her carcass at dat many dollars?”
Figger asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” Skeeter replied doubtfully. “All
she said wus dat she wus <i>wuth</i> one thousan’
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” Figger grunted skeptically. “She
mought be pricin’ herse’f too high.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the green-baize doors of the saloon
were thrust aside, and a clear voice called:</p>

<p>“Oh, Skeeter! Come out here!”</p>

<p>Skeeter jumped like someone had popped a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
dynamite cap under his chair, and hastened out to
the front. Figger followed slowly for the purpose
of getting a good look at Skeeter’s new girl.</p>

<p>She was well worth seeing. She was as slim and
straight and graceful as a stalk of sugar-cane; her
color was a little darker than Skeeter’s; an Ethiopian
type, with perfect features, a sinewy, cat-like
movement of muscles under satiny skin, easy-smiling
lips, which played constantly over perfectly
beautiful teeth, and a speaking voice which
any orator in the world would covet.</p>

<p>“Lawd,” Figger sighed enviously. “She’s wuth
de thousan’ dollars, all right.”</p>

<p>“I wants my dawg, Skeeter,” Tella Tandy said.
“I’s gwine down to de deppo to watch de train come
in. Want to come wid me an’ tote de dawg?”</p>

<p>“No’m,” Skeeter answered regretfully, as he
snapped his fingers and the little Spitz leaped under
the saloon doors and sprang into his owner’s arms.
“I got to make a livin’ keepin’ bar. I’ll go wid
you some yuther time.”</p>

<p>The woman walked down the street and Skeeter
returned to the table where he had been sitting.
He sighed like a furnace and wiped the sweat from
his face.</p>

<p>“Figger,” he said pantingly, “dat gal nearly
gibs me de jim-jams eve’y time I sees her. I
loses all de good sense I’m got. I feels like a fool
an’ I acks like a fool, an’ ’pears to me like dat gal is
laughin’ at me all de time.”</p>

<p>“I ’spect so,” Figger said commiseratingly, as
he arose to go. “Dem females is mos’ in gineral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
laughin’ at us. But dem simpletoms you announce
is shore a bad sign. Mattermony’ll ketch
you ef you don’t watch out. Ef you needs any
good advices, I ’speck you better send fer me.”</p>

<p>Figger sauntered down to the depot, watched
the passenger train arrive and depart, and then
hurried back to the Hen-Scratch saloon.</p>

<p>“Bad luck, Skeeter!” he howled, as soon as he
entered the room. “Dat Tella Tandy went down
to de deppo to meet a man an’ dat man looks like
one of dese here watermillyumaires!”</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy!” Skeeter squeaked, springing
to his feet. “I knowed my luck wus too good to
last. Whar is dat new nigger man at?”</p>

<p>“Dey is bofe comin’ up dis way,” Figger
informed him. “Dat new man is packin’ de Spit
dawg. I figger de load will break him down about
time he gits to de Hen-Scratch.”</p>

<p>For ten minutes the two sat in gloomy silence.
Skeeter lighted cigarette after cigarette, twiddled
his thumbs, jiggered his feet, and acted generally
like a man with the St. Vitus dance. Figger was
more composed. He was thankful that he was
merely an innocent bystander. At last Skeeter
sighed:</p>

<p>“Ef I lose dat gal, it’ll bust my heart, Figger. I
been courtin’ her servigerous fer a week. My head
is so full of tears now it would take a week to bail
me out!”</p>

<p>Voices were heard at the door and Skeeter arose
tremblingly and walked out. Tella and the
strange man were waiting for him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>“Dis is my frein’, Mr. Deo Diddle, Skeeter,”
Tella said easily. “I jes’ been tellin’ him how kind
you wus to keep my dawg.”</p>

<p>“Glad to meet yo’ ’quaintance,” Skeeter
mumbled, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>“Same back at you,” Deo replied. Then
turning to Tella Tandy, he said: “Me an’ dis
dawg is got a little bizzness wid Mr. Muskeeter
Butts, Tella. You foller yo’ little nose down de
street an’ see ef he don’t lead you somewhar else.”</p>

<p>Skeeter and Deo Diddle entered the saloon and
sat down at the table with Figger Bush. The dog
sniffed around the room for a minute and then
passed out toward the rear.</p>

<p>Deo Diddle was about the size of Skeeter Butts,
but it required no expert eyes to see that he was a
perfect athlete. The poise of his head and body,
the accuracy and decision of even the slightest
move, the steady, assured gaze of his eyes indicated
a man whose muscles and brain were trained
in some field of endeavor which required both
strength and wit.</p>

<p>“At de fust offstartin’, Mr. Butts,” Deo Diddle
began easily, “I announces my bizzness an’ de
puppus of my visit to Tickfall: I’s a Monarch of de
Manacle.”</p>

<p>“You’s a&mdash;a&mdash;<i>which</i>?” Skeeter asked, his eyes
sticking out like a bug’s.</p>

<p>“I gibs a show,” Deo Diddle explained. “I
lets people handcuff me an’ I slips ’em off as easy
as you kin take off a glove. I lets people nail me
up in a box an’ I gits out as easy as you kin git
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
outen dat chair. I lets people tie me in bed wid
ropes an’ I gits loose as easy as a pickaninny kin
fall outen a hammock. An’ on de side, I tells
forchines, reads minds, finds lost treasures, an’
gives a few sleight-of-han’ tricks.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Skeeter and Figger grunted in a duet.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Deo Diddle went on. “I done
hired dat hall down in de settlemint called Dirty-Six,
an’ I’s gibin’ a show eve’y night fer three
nights. Would you wish to come?”</p>

<p>“I shore would!” Skeeter exclaimed eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’s glad to hear you say dat, suh,” Deo replied.
“I’s gwine gib a free pass to you an’ Mr. Bush,
an’ I hopes you will speak up my show fer me.
Admission ten cents fer chillun an’ two-bits fer
growed-ups!”</p>

<p>He handed Skeeter and Figger a slip of paper
apiece, and rose and walked out of the saloon,
leaving the two men to gaze after him in speechless
astonishment. After a long time, Figger
remarked:</p>

<p>“You done got yo’ wuck cut out fer you, Skeeter.
You know how batty female womans is about show
folks!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A show given by negroes will attract other
negroes as a barrel of molasses attracts flies. The
little hall in Dirty-Six was filled to its capacity a
long time before the hour of the exhibition.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts and Figger Bush occupied the
front seat directly facing the center of the stage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>“Whar is Tella Tandy, Figger?” Skeeter asked
uneasily, scanning the faces in the crowd. “I
went to her house atter her an’ dey tole me she’d
done went. But I don’t see her.”</p>

<p>“She’ll git here on time,” Figger assured him.
“She ain’t hatin’ dis Deo Diddle none, an’ she’ll
watch him pufform.”</p>

<p>Then the ragged curtain parted in the middle,
one half being pulled to each side of the
stage.</p>

<p>“Ladies an’ gen’lemans,” Deo Diddle began,
“I’s gwine gib a refined exhibition of sleight-of-hands
fust of all, an’ I defy anybody to kotch me
at my tricks.”</p>

<p>The stunts which followed were too simple and
commonplace to mention, but they were wonderful
because new to the Tickfall negroes. In a little
while the whole house was vocal with the comments
of the spectators, who made remarks in a
loud voice, and sometimes got into an argument
with some friend across the room.</p>

<p>“My Lawd,” Hitch Diamond bellowed, when he
saw the performer break an egg in a pan, scramble
it, light an alcohol lamp and cook it, then lift out
of the pan a live goose. “My Lawd, dat pufformance
is agin nature!”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so!” the Reverend Vinegar Atts bawled
from the other side of the house. “De Good Book
says us shall see wonders in de heaven above an’ de
yearth beneath&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aw, go up dar wid de buzzards!” Hitch Diamond
retorted in a disgusted tone. “Not even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
de good Lawd could make a nigger hatch a goose
outen a scrambled hen’s egg!”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Deo Diddle had turned his
attention to a stove-pipe hat belonging to Vinegar
Atts, and was winding yard after yard of colored
paper out of the crown, catching it upon a wand.</p>

<p>“Us knowed you never did carry no brains in dat
hat, Revun, even when you had it on yo’ head!”
Pap Curtain guffawed.</p>

<p>The spectators were getting their money’s
worth when Deo Diddle suddenly changed the
performance.</p>

<p>“Friends,” he announced, “I’s gwine interjuice
you to de mos’ wonderful woman in de worl’. She
kin set right here in dis chair an’ tell you-alls all
about yo’se’ves! She don’t know nobody in dis
town, but she is gwine mention names an’ tell
secrets out loud whut nobody ain’t told her but de
departed sperits of de yuther land!”</p>

<p>At that moment Tella Tandy walked out upon
the stage and sat down.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts sprang to his feet with a startled
exclamation, then sank back again with a cold
sick sensation at the pit of his stomach.</p>

<p>“Dat means I done lost my little she-goddess,
Figger,” he sighed pitifully. “’Tain’t no use to
hope no more.”</p>

<p>“Aw, pert up, Skeeter!” his friend urged. “You
ain’t drapped de pertater yit!”</p>

<p>Tella Tandy appeared to be in a trance. She
looked with unseeing eyes over the faces of the
crowd, then began in a weak, uncertain voice:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>“I ketch de name of Vinegar Atts&mdash;I sees a fly&mdash;shoo
fly!&mdash;church. Revun Atts is ’postlizin’ in de
pulpit&mdash;de elder is gwine hab trouble in de cong’gation&mdash;he
better watch his eye&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I ketch de name of Prince Total&mdash;Marse Tom
am lookin’ fer dat lost demijahm whut Prince borrered&mdash;I
’speck Prince better fotch dat jug back befo’
he keeps it buried too long by dat pine stump&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I ketch de name of Pap Curtain&mdash;Pap is a
slick-head nigger&mdash;a word from de sperit lan’ tells
Pap dat he better ketch de trabbel itch an’ hike&mdash;de
gram-jury meets nex’ week&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>For twenty minutes this revelation held the
audience in tense, dreadful silence&mdash;twenty minutes
of frightful retrospection and introspection,
and when a negro’s name was mentioned that
darky suffered a nervous shock from which he did
not recover for a week. Even if his name was not
mentioned, the darky was afraid it would be, and
was appalled at what the revelation might be.</p>

<p>At last Tella Tandy rose from the chair, felt her
way toward the side of the stage as if she were
blind, rubbed her hands over her dazed eyes, and
exclaimed in a dramatic voice:</p>

<p>“De book of de recordin’ angel is closed, an’ de
sperit land reveals no more!”</p>

<p>“Bless Gawd!” Hitch Diamond bellowed fervently.</p>

<p>Deo Diddle then brought out a cot and set it in
the middle of the stage. He threw down upon the
floor a coil of rope many feet in length and addressed
the audience:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>“I wants about ten men to come up on dis flatform
and tie me to dis cot. I offers to bet ten
dollars I kin git loose in two minutes!”</p>

<p>“I takes dat bet, bully!” Skeeter Butts squealed
as he sprang to his feet and climbed upon the
platform.</p>

<p>“Me, too!” came a chorus of voices, and Vinegar
Atts, Prince Total, Pap Curtain, Hitch Diamond,
and a number of others who had been
accused of various crimes and misdemeanors by
Tella Tandy followed Skeeter to the stage.</p>

<p>They carefully examined the cot and rope.
Then Deo Diddle stretched himself out upon it,
lying flat upon the mattress with his feet together
and his hands down at his sides. Vinegar Atts
and Hitch Diamond passed the rope around and
around him, crossing and crisscrossing it over his
feet and body and neck until he was swathed like
a mummy and apparently as helpless.</p>

<p>Then the committee climbed off the platform
and left Deo to free himself in full view of the
crowd.</p>

<p>Deo entertained the crowd for a minute by a
mighty struggling and tugging and jerking and
grunting, but all the while Deo’s right hand was
resting upon a lateral bar under the cot which held
the mattress taut. At the proper time Deo simply
slipped this bar out of its fastening on one side of
the cot; the mattress sagged down in the middle
like a hammock, with the many coils of rope across
Deo, but hardly touching his body.</p>

<p>Then Deo climbed from under the rope as easily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
as a pig slips through a gap in the fence and was
free!</p>

<p>The shout of applause which greeted this performance
almost lifted the roof, and amid the noise
Deo and Tella quickly removed the cot so that the
committee could not examine it again.</p>

<p>“Us will hab a entirely diffunt show tomorrer
night, my frien’s,” Deo announced when the noise
and excitement subsided. “I is knowed all over de
worl’ an’ in Yurope as de Monarch of de Manacle.
I’s de only real nigger Handcuff King in dis country.
Tomorrer night I’s gwine hab eve’y kind of handcuff
whut is used by de sheriffs an’ policemens of
dis country an’ furin parts, and I’ll let you handcuff
me up any way you please, an’ ef I don’t git
loose in five minutes I’ll gib you twenty-five dollars
reward. Fetch all de handcuffs you is got aroun’
de house an’ watch de Handcuff King pufform!”</p>

<p>“I’ll git dat reward-bill!” Skeeter Butts
squealed.</p>

<p>“All right, pardner!” Deo laughed. “Do yo’
durndest! Good-night!”</p>

<p>While the people were leaving Skeeter Butts
climbed back upon the stage and confronted Tella
Tandy.</p>

<p>“Is you married to dis Deo Diddle, Tella?” he
asked earnestly.</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Tella laughed. “Ain’t Deo a
wonder?”</p>

<p>“Whut you mean by makin’ a fool outen me?”
Skeeter demanded.</p>

<p>“Don’t pick no fuss wid me, Skeeter!” Tella
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
said. “Dis is a free country an’ you made love at
me wid yo’ own mind. I couldn’t he’p it ef you
handed me yo’ heart tied up in a paper-sack.”</p>

<p>Skeeter glared at her a moment, then turned and
started away.</p>

<p>“I don’t bear you no grudge fer dem lovin’
words, Skeeter,” Tella snickered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Skeeter Butts spent a large part of the night in
deep meditation.</p>

<p>The next morning all his friends crowded into
the Hen-Scratch to discuss the show. Tella Tandy’s
revelations interested them most.</p>

<p>“How come dat purty little coon knowed all
about me so good?” Vinegar Atts wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“How did she know dat a gram-jury meetin’ is
de real sign fer me to leave dis town?” Pap Curtain
inquired.</p>

<p>“How did she guess dat I swiped Marse Tom
Gaitskill’s licker-jug an’ had it hid out ferninst a
pine stump?” Prince Total wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I kin answer all dem ’terrogations, niggers,”
Skeeter Butts grinned. “When dat gal fust come
to town I didn’t know she wus connected up wid
no show, an’ I didn’t had no idear she wus married,
an’ I armed her aroun’ an’ tried to git her to love
me. She axed me about a millyum questions
about you-alls, an’ las’ night when she pulled up
dat stunt she was jes’ repeatin’ over whut I done
tole her!”</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” Prince Total exclaimed. “Dat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
warn’t no fair. I wus mighty nigh skeart to
death.”</p>

<p>“I reckin so,” Vinegar Atts bellowed. “Yo’
mem’ry ain’t loaded wid nothin’ but blank ca’tridges
ontil people begins to talk about yo’
meanness&mdash;den yo’ shore is got plenty ammunition
of remembrunce.”</p>

<p>“I hope she ain’t gwine pull no more of dat
stuff,” Pap Curtain said uneasily. “How much
did you tell her ’bout me, Skeeter?”</p>

<p>“She’s done turned loose all she knows,” Skeeter
replied.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” Pap said menacingly. “Ef she
revelates any mo’ about me I knows a yeller-faced
bar-keep’ who is gwine hab his mug pounded into
anodder color.”</p>

<p>“No danger&mdash;I ain’t skeart,” Skeeter said with
a dry grin. “I realizes dat wus a mistake.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a few minutes, a drink for
the crowd at Skeeter’s expense, and then Skeeter
mentioned a plan he had matured in the night:</p>

<p>“Cain’t us niggers fix up some kind of buzzo
on dat gal an’ git even wid her?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Whut mought dat buzzo be?” Vinegar Atts
inquired.</p>

<p>“Well, suh, I figgers it out dis way: Dat Deo
Diddle is offered a reward fer any handcuffs he
can’t git out of. Now ef Sheriff Marse John
Flournoy would only loan us some handcuffs&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Listen to dat nigger’s brains a-poppin’!”
Prince Total exclaimed in extreme admiration.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
“Fer mussy sake, Skeeter, go see Marse John right
now. I’ll keep dis saloom.”</p>

<p>The crowd sat down to wait while Skeeter hastened
to the courthouse, entered the sheriff’s
office, and stood, hat in hand, grinning at Mr.
John Flournoy.</p>

<p>“Come in, Skeeter,” Flournoy said. “I won’t
lend any money, won’t hear any nigger love scrapes,
won’t give any advice, won’t listen to any of your
troubles. Excusing all those things, what else
do you want?”</p>

<p>Skeeter grinned. As he would have expressed
it, Marse John was his “kinnery.” He had grown
up in a cabin in the sheriff’s yard, and this big-bodied,
kind-hearted sheriff held few terrors for
Skeeter.</p>

<p>“Dar, now, Marse John, you’ll shore hab room
fer a good appetite atter you is got all dem words
offen yo’ stomick. I come to git a view from you
about how to colleck a twenty-five dollars reward-bill.”</p>

<p>“That’s interesting,” Flournoy grinned. “Let’s
have the details.”</p>

<p>“Well, suh, a nigger is habin’ a show in dis town
an’ he calls hisse’f a Handcuff King. He specify
dat he’s a Monarch of de Manacle. He argufy
dat dar ain’t no kind of handcuff made dat he
can’t git hisse’f loose from in less’n five minutes.
Does you reckin dat is so, Marse John?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” the sheriff answered promptly.</p>

<p>“How come?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>This was one theme upon which the sheriff was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
competent to speak. He leaned back in his chair,
lighted a cigar, and began:</p>

<p>“There are one hundred and forty-two varieties
of handcuffs and leg-irons manufactured in the
civilized world, Skeeter, but there are only thirty-two
separate brands which are registered for use
by officers of the law in the United States. Four
master keys will unlock all thirty-two of these
leg-irons and handcuffs.”</p>

<p>“Listen to dat!” Skeeter exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I venture to say that that negro showman
has all the regulation handcuffs in use in this
country, as well as some of European manufacture.
Of course, he also has the keys to unlock
them.”</p>

<p>“Whar do he tote de keys?” Skeeter asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;everywhere!” Flournoy smiled. “In the
lining of his clothes, in his shoes and socks, in his
sleeves and cuffs, down his collar, even in his
mouth&mdash;everywhere!”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Skeeter grunted. “Dat’s too bad.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence while Flournoy smilingly
watched Skeeter think. The negro’s face
was a pantomime of conflicting emotions, and the
general effect made for gloom and depression.
Finally Flournoy spoke:</p>

<p>“My information seems to discourage you,
Skeeter. What’s the problem?”</p>

<p>“It’s dis way, Marse John,” Skeeter said earnestly.
“Dat uppity, biggity nigger is done offered
twenty-five dollars reward fer any handcuff he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
cain’t git off in five minutes, an’ I figgered dat I
had a show to make de money.”</p>

<p>Flournoy thought a moment, then broke into a
loud chuckle.</p>

<p>“I think you have a splendid chance to copper
the coin, Skeeter. Wait here a minute!”</p>

<p>Flournoy opened a steel door, walked to the
rear of the vault, and pawed over a lot of trash in
one corner. Then he came out and tossed a handful
of police hardware on the floor at Skeeter’s feet.</p>

<p>“I think they will hold him,” Flournoy laughed.</p>

<p>Skeeter gasped as he eyed the cruelest collection
of manacles and shackles he had ever seen.</p>

<p>There was a pair of home-made wrought-iron
handcuffs with a stiff iron bar a foot long to connect
the bracelets instead of a chain. There was a pair
of cumbersome leg-irons which were used a half
century ago in Southern convict camps, but whose
use is now prohibited. And there was something
else which gave Skeeter a sinking sensation at the
pit of his stomach merely to look at. It was a pair
of trigger cuffs. Any attempt to loosen them by
the wearer has the effect of tightening the bracelets
while at the same time a needle trigger presses
deeper and deeper into the flesh of the wrist until
the captive is helpless with pain.</p>

<p>“When I was first elected sheriff, forty years
ago, this stuff was in use, Skeeter. I won’t give
you the keys to these manacles. If you get them
on that coon he’ll certainly need me! You can
telephone me at the house to-night after Deo the
Diddle forks over that twenty-five plunks to you!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>Skeeter wrapped the hardware in a newspaper
and trod on air as he walked back to the Hen-Scratch
saloon. When he told the waiting crowd
of his success and showed them the manacles the
darkies had a jubilee and then waited with the
impatience of children for the night to come.</p>

<p>The front row of seats was occupied that night
by Skeeter Butts, Figger Bush, Vinegar Atts, Pap
Curtain, Prince Total, Hitch Diamond, and a few
others of that type who were smarting under the
public revelations of the recording angel the night
before.</p>

<p>The house was crowded to suffocation and the
performance consisted of fortune-telling, feats of
magic, singing, and dancing.</p>

<p>At last the time came for the Monarch of the
Manacle to make good his boast that he could get
out of any handcuff or leg-iron which the community
could provide for his bonds.</p>

<p>Up to this time Deo had found it perfectly safe
everywhere to offer to release himself from any
handcuffs which the negroes could provide, for a
handcuff was something which no negro possessed,
and with all their barbaric love of jewelry it was
an ornament which no darky cared to wear. When
no manacles were supplied by the audience, Deo
would then invite a committee to come upon the
stage and examine his. He would present forty
different kinds for their inspection and let them
choose any sort to place upon his legs and wrists. As
they were all familiar to Deo, well oiled and in good
condition, he had no trouble in releasing himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>But this time Deo Diddle was up against it!</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts was Sheriff John Flournoy’s
“nigger.” And for that reason he was probably
the only colored person in the South who could go
to a sheriff and get the assortment of manacles
which he now had wrapped in a newspaper and
hidden under his seat.</p>

<p>When Deo invited a local committee to come
upon the stage, asking for anyone who would
volunteer, every occupant of the first row of seats
sprang to his feet and started for the platform.</p>

<p>This prompt and concerted action told Deo
Diddle that he was in danger, that the men were
out for his blood. He was frightened, and although
he tried to carry himself with an easy manner it
was apparent to all the committee that he was
anxious and distrait.</p>

<p>Deo promptly decided not to ask for any handcuffs
to be provided by the people in the assembly.
To cover his retreat he began his announcement of
the next evening’s performance:</p>

<p>“Dis is de las’ stunt on our plogram to-night,
but tomorrer we is gwine hab de biggest show of
all. I’ll ax a cormittee to nail me up in a box
atter dey has handcuffed me, an’ I’ll let ’em tie de
box up wid a rope, an’ I’ll promise to git out in
five minutes!”</p>

<p>Then for twenty minutes Deo entertained the
audience by escaping from his own leg-irons and
handcuffs. The negroes devised every sort of
method to manacle his legs and wrists, but when
the curtain of the little booth which was rigged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
upon the stage had been pulled together in half a
minute or a minute Deo walked out a free man!</p>

<p>Then Skeeter Butts unwrapped his newspaper
and tossed his assortment of police hardware at
the feet of Deo Diddle!</p>

<p>Deo looked down at that appalling mass of
wrought iron and steel and shuddered. He had
never seen anything like them before. His heart
stood still and his breath stopped. Then he
laughed, a nervous, cackling, uneasy laugh, merely
to gain time to think.</p>

<p>He picked up the three dreadful instruments
and held them before the audience&mdash;the wrought-iron
bracelets with the lateral bar&mdash;old, rusty, out
of date, the keyhole filled with rust and dirt;
the horrible leg-irons which a man could not
escape from in half a day with the use of a sharp
file, and the cruel trigger cuffs with their torturing
needle. He described each fetter minutely, explained
how it was made, told how quickly and
easily he expected to escape from its bonds, all the
time praying desperately for some way of escape
from his awful predicament.</p>

<p>During this speech Tella Tandy came and sat
down beside Skeeter Butts. Skeeter grinned
triumphantly into her face, then gave his entire
attention to the spiel of Deo Diddle. Several
times Tella spoke to Skeeter, but he answered in
gruff tones and finally told her to shut up.</p>

<p>Then Deo did something which made Skeeter’s
jaw drop with despair&mdash;he closed each of the gaping
manacles with a loud snap!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

<p>And Skeeter did not have a key to open them
again!</p>

<p>Then Tella Tandy did a most astounding thing&mdash;she
sprang to her feet with a loud, shrill scream!</p>

<p>Everybody turned and looked at her with astonishment&mdash;Skeeter
Butts most astonished of all.</p>

<p>“Whut you mean by sayin’ dat to me, Skeeter
Butts?” she whooped. “You is a low-down nigger
to insult a lady like dat! Oh, my Gawd!”</p>

<p>Tella put her hands over her face and staggered
from the stage, crying aloud like a baby.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butt’s jaw dropped down and he gaped like
an idiot&mdash;he had not said a word or done a thing!</p>

<p>He was so startled by the woman’s accusation
and her dramatic exit that when he tried to speak
and deny his guilt he stammered and spluttered
and looked guiltier than ever.</p>

<p>“Whut you mean by insultin’ my wife, you low-down
animated outrage?” Deo Diddle howled,
approaching Skeeter with blood in his eye.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;didn’t&mdash;say&mdash;nothin’!” Skeeter stammered.</p>

<p>“Kill him! Put him out! Bust him one in de
jaw!” the men in the audience roared, as they
listened to the heart-rending wails of the caterwauling
Tella Tandy somewhere in the wings.</p>

<p>Deo Diddle’s fist lunged out with all his strength
behind it. Skeeter ducked, dodged under the
showman’s arms, grabbed up Sheriff Flournoy’s
criminal hardware, and fled for his life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning Skeeter was kept busy explaining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
to his many patrons that he had been guilty of
no offense and that Tella Tandy had played a trick
on him to keep him from winning the twenty-five
dollars.</p>

<p>To Skeeter’s surprise, nobody believed him.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh,” the reverend Vinegar Atts proclaimed,
“you muss hab said somepin shameful to
dat little gal. She wusn’t show-actin’ when she
bust out cryin’ like dat.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de way I figger,” Hitch Diamond
growled. “Ef you wus a’ innercent man, how
come you didn’t stan’ yo’ ground’ an’ fight when
dat Deo wus fixin’ to pound yo’ face in?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t no fightin’ man,” Skeeter protested.
“I’s a bizzness man. But I didn’t say nothin’
an’ I didn’t do nothin’&mdash;I wus discriminated agin
by dem show folks!”</p>

<p>“Aw, hush!” Pap Curtain exclaimed disgustedly.
“I heerd whut you said to dat little gal an’ it wus
plum’ insultin’.”</p>

<p>“You better fetch dem same handcuffs back tonight,
Skeeter,” Prince Total grinned. “Yo’ bes’
chance to insult dat lady is atter we nail Deo up in
dat box.”</p>

<p>“Aw, shut up!” Skeeter snapped.</p>

<p>The men gradually talked themselves out and
went away. Skeeter turned to his one friend and
sympathizer, Figger Bush.</p>

<p>“Figger,” he said, “I’s gwine git even wid dat
pair of crooks or die. Is you willin’ to he’p me?”</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Figger agreed eagerly. “I think
dem show folks done you powerful bad.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<p>“We begins right now,” Skeeter announced, as
he got up and went back to a rear room and came
out with Tella’s Spitz dog.</p>

<p>“Come out in front wid me, Figger,” Skeeter
said, as he led the dog out of the door and stopped
in the middle of the cinder sidewalk. “I want
you to hold dis dawg for me.”</p>

<p>“Whut you gwine do?” Figger inquired.</p>

<p>“I’s gwine git back about fawty feet, take a
little run, an’ kick dis dang dawg so fur dat de
nex’ time he spits it’ll be in Arkansas!” Skeeter
announced viciously.</p>

<p>“I’s wid you!” Figger chuckled, as he spraddled
his legs and grasped the Pomeranian by his bushy,
silky tail. “Kick de goal!”</p>

<p>Skeeter made a little run and almost kicked a
hole in the sky. His right foot went up like he
had hitched it to a star. For the little dog squatted
and Skeeter missed him!</p>

<p>Then the dog got busy.</p>

<p>He snapped at Figger and Figger let go his tail.
He sunk his sharp little teeth in the seat of
Skeeter’s pantaloons and Skeeter went down the
street at full speed, exhausting the treasuries of
his throat to vocalize his fright. The dog held
on until the seat of Skeeter’s trousers parted company
with the rest of the garment and came away.
Then the dog, well satisfied, trotted happily down
the street, growling ferociously and stopping at
intervals to shake the everlasting stuffing out of
the piece of cloth which he had captured.</p>

<p>Figger Bush lay flat down upon the ground and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
whooped with laughter until the town reverberated
with the echo of his hilarity like a pack of hounds
chasing a fox. When he saw Skeeter returning, he
decided it would be safer to go down town and see
what time it was. So he went.</p>

<p>But in less than an hour Figger returned in great
excitement, bringing with him a little, timid negro
woman with a tiny baby upon her arm.</p>

<p>He led her through the saloon to a rear room,
motioning mysteriously to Skeeter as he passed.
When they were all seated at a table Figger said:</p>

<p>“Now, Mrs. Diddle, you tell dat tale whut you
jes’ told me&mdash;dis man who wants to listen is
Skeeter Butts.”</p>

<p>The woman hesitated a moment, looked down
fondly at the tiny bundle on her breast, and began
to speak in a trembling, uneasy voice:</p>

<p>“I come up here huntin’ fer a nigger named Deo
Diddle. He’s my cote-house husbund. Dis is his
little pickaninny chile I’s nursin’. Deo, he gibs
shows, but he’s got kinder keerless an’ done fergot
all about me, I reckin. So I come to rattle up his
remembrunce.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Skeeter exclaimed with unction.
“Dat wus de most properest thing you could do.
I’s shore glad you foun’ me so prompt, fer I’s jes’
de man to lead you straight on to Deo Diddle.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s fine,” the woman exclaimed, rising
eagerly to her feet. “I hopes you’ll take me dar
right now.”</p>

<p>“No’m,” Skeeter declared. “It cain’t be did
suddent like dat. I don’t know whar dat nigger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
is now, but he’s gwine gib a show in dis town to-night,
an’ I’ll take good keer of you an’ dat baby
an’ den lead you to de show. Dat is, ef you’ll do
jes’ whut I tells you.”</p>

<p class="caption">Skeeter went down the street at full speed.</p></div>

<p>“I shore will,” the woman said fervently.</p>

<p>“Figger,” Skeeter commanded, “you take sister
Diddle over to de Halfacre an’ tell ole sister Ginny
Chew to keep her till I come atter her to-night.
Den you come right back to dis saloom, an’
you an’ me will fix up our plans fer de evenin’
pufformance.”</p>

<p>The day passed slowly for Skeeter Butts, and
when the night came he occupied a seat in the
front row in the hall directly in the center of the
stage, with Figger Bush sitting beside him.</p>

<p>None of the performance interested Skeeter
until Deo Diddle announced that he was now
ready to accomplish the “box escape.” He
challenged the negroes to provide a pine box in
which he would be securely nailed and roped
up, first being handcuffed and shackled in any
way the negroes chose. Then he proposed to
escape, leaving the box and the ropes intact.</p>

<p>When the committee climbed upon the stage,
Skeeter did not join them. He handed a tiny
vial of liquid to Figger Bush and said:</p>

<p>“Now, Figger, you go up dar an’ do exackly
whut I told you!”</p>

<p>Deo Diddle was carefully handcuffed, manacled,
chained, and bound by the grinning, laughing
negroes; then he was lifted up and lowered
carefully into the box.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>Figger Bush reached for a hammer, and Tella
Tandy stood by with a cigar box full of long wire
nails, handing them to Figger as he nailed Deo in
the box. Then Tella produced a long rope, and
the husky negroes bound that box as a trunk is
wrapped for a journey. When all were satisfied
they stepped back, but Figger returned for a
moment and made another careful examination of
the box and the ropes.</p>

<p>Finally the curtains were drawn around the
little booth and the crowd waited breathlessly.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts arose and hastily departed from
the hall.</p>

<p>Two things had happened to Deo Diddle which
were sure to cause him trouble, and Deo found
it out instantly.</p>

<p>First, Figger Bush had nailed Deo’s coat-tail
to the top of the box. And second, when Figger
went back to examine the box a second time he had
emptied a small bottle of formaldehyde into one
of the air-holes!</p>

<p>If there is one chemical fluid with which the
inhabitants of Louisiana, white and black, are
familiar, it is that colorless, volatile liquid, chemically
intermediate between methyl alcohol and
formic acid, called formaldehyde. It has an odor
which suggests all the dead and decaying things
of earth, animal and vegetable, all the putrefaction
and corruption imaginable. When a man
gets a whiff of it for the first time, he kneels down
right there and prays to die&mdash;he doesn’t want to
live another second with that stench in his nostrils.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
It is the supreme germicide and disinfectant of
every yellow-fever epidemic, which accounts for
Louisiana’s close and intimate acquaintance with
it. Any self-respecting yellow-fever germ will
instantly tuck his tail and scoot when he gets a
good smell of that gosh-awful disinfectant.</p>

<p>But formaldehyde was a preparation with
which Deo Diddle was not acquainted.</p>

<p>Figger Bush, listening intently, heard sounds
which resembled those made by a dog having a fit
in a cigar box and knocking his feet against the
box on all sides. Then Figger heard a loud panting
like a worn-out engine pulling a grade with a
log-train. After that, a moan, which deepened
into a hoarse cry; then Deo Diddle lost hold of
himself completely and began a hideous sort of
sharp yelping like a dog.</p>

<p>“Hel-lup! Hel-lup! Fer Gawd’s sake&mdash;&mdash;”
he screamed.</p>

<p>But long before this Tella Tandy had torn
the curtains aside and was fighting the box with
her hands, trying to let in the air.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts, standing by the door at the side
entrance with Mrs. Deo Diddle and the baby,
heard the excitement and the screaming, and
grinned with delight.</p>

<p>“Come on, sister Diddle,” Skeeter exclaimed
exultantly. “I’ll show you yo’ kind, good husbunt
now. Us is got him in a box!”</p>

<p>He led her through the side entrance to the
stage just as Vinegar Atts struck the pine box a
heavy blow with the ax, cut the ropes, knocked off
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
the top, and lifted the half-unconscious, and wholly
terrified Handcuff King out of the box, his coat-tail
nailed securely, his hands and ankles still
manacled, and the bottom of the box containing
dozens of keys which Deo had dropped in his
eagerness and haste to escape!</p>

<p>In the meantime, the entire audience had taken
its departure. Even Vinegar Atts left after he
released the formaldehyde with the magician.
There was no attraction on the stage which
could enable them to endure that dreadful odor.
Figger Bush lingered around the front door, sticking
his head out at intervals to get a breath of
pure air.</p>

<p>“Dat’s him!” Skeeter exclaimed dramatically,
as he pointed to the drooping form of Deo Diddle,
who was rapidly reviving, although he still hung
to the shattered box by his coat-tail. “Dat’s
de villyum whut is done run off from his wife an’
chile an’ tuck up wid anodder woman!”</p>

<p>“Who&mdash;<i>him!</i>” Mrs. Diddle exclaimed, pointing
to the performer. “Huh&mdash;dat ain’t my husbant&mdash;his
name is Jim Tom Wyatt!”</p>

<p>Then she turned and faced the frightened Tella
Tandy.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tella!” she exclaimed. “Whar is
Deo?”</p>

<p>“He got drunk in Kerlerac an’ fit a white man to
a shirt-tail finish an’ de jedge put him in jail fer
fawty days,” Tella explained. “Me an’ Jim Tom is
tryin’ to carry on de show till Deo gits out, an’,
of co’se, Jim Tom is usin’ Deo’s name.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>“Dar now, Skeeter Butts!” Mrs. Diddle exclaimed.
“Whut you lie to me fer?”</p>

<p>“Did dat little yeller debbil hab anything to do
wid dis?” Tella asked, pointing at Skeeter’s face.</p>

<p>“Of co’se he did!” Mrs. Diddle exclaimed.
“He done it all!”</p>

<p>Tella Tandy promptly wrenched off a piece of
the shattered box about two feet long and three
inches wide, and gave Skeeter a resounding slap
across the jaw.</p>

<p>Skeeter reeled backward, stumbled down the
steps, and fled out into the street.</p>

<p>Figger watched the people on the stage for a
minute, then hastened down the street after
Skeeter. He found his friend sitting on a curb-stone
nursing a bloody face.</p>

<p>“Dey done me up, Figger,” Skeeter mourned.
“I never seed de beat of show-folks fer fust-rate
brains. Even dat Spit dawg is smarter dan me!”</p>

<p>“Whut is us gwine do nex’, Skeeter?” Bush
asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>“I’s gwine to de cote-house an’ hab dat Tella
Tandy arrested fer assault an’ battery!” Skeeter
exclaimed revengefully.</p>

<p>Figger sighed pitifully.</p>

<p>“’Twon’t do you no good, Skeeter,” Figger
informed him. “You can’t git her fer nothin’ but
assault.”</p>

<p>“How come?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>“Atter she hit you dat whale across de face,”
Figger explained, “I saw her take de ax an’ chop
dat battery all to little pieces!”

<h3>I<br />

THE HORSE RACE.</h3>

<p>Shin Bone needed money badly. He sat on
the edge of the sidewalk by the old cotton shed,
his feet in the gutter and his head resting upon
his hands, and did the heaviest thinking of his
whole thoughtless life.</p>

<p>“I’d rob Marse Tom’s bank ef I jes’ knowed
how,” he said, speaking aloud to himself.</p>

<p>Then he wondered if he had spoken too loud, for
Colonel Tom Gaitskill stopped directly behind
him in his walk to the bank, and surveyed with
amusement a number of gaudy lithographs which
had been pasted upon the side of the cotton
shed.</p>

<p>Shin Bone sat perfectly quiet until he had
assured himself that Gaitskill had not overheard
him, then a shrewd look came into his eyes, and he
rose to his feet. Taking a corn-cob pipe from his
pocket, he filled it with tobacco, and edged up
closer to the white man.</p>

<p>“When is de succus gwine be, Marse Tom?” he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
asked, as he struck a match and applied the flame
to the bowl of his pipe.</p>

<p>“This is no circus, Shin,” Gaitskill said shortly.
“Where have you been all the time? Haven’t
you heard anything about the nigger uplift?”</p>

<p>Every negro knows the advantage which accrues
to himself from letting the white man tell him.
Carefully concealing the fact that these same
gaudy lithographs had caused his grief over his
poverty, Shin said:</p>

<p>“Naw, suh&mdash;yes, suh. De white folks is always
doin’ somepin to us niggers. But I cain’t figger
out dese shiny new bills on dis wall.”</p>

<p>“Those lithographs announce a negro fair at
the old race track,” Colonel Gaitskill told him.
“There will be prizes for all kinds of garden truck
and field crops, prizes for chickens, pigs, and cattle,
prizes for draft horses, carriage horses, and all
kinds of horses. Admission is free for all the
negroes, all the exhibits will be by the negroes,
and the white folks are financing the fair for the
benefit of the negroes.”</p>

<p>“Dat shore will be a lift-up,” Shin Bone grinned,
as he gazed with admiration at the pictures of
the running horses. “Does us be allowed to had
races, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’ll be speed exhibits,” Gaitskill
smiled. “But every negro who enters a horse for
a race must own the horse.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Shin Bone agreed heartily. “Ef
dat’s de rule, de niggers cain’t borry no real race
hosses an’ git all our money away from us.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>“Betting will not be permitted,” Gaitskill
remarked, watching Shin Bone closely. “That
is against the law.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” Shin Bone grunted, and the tone of his
voice and the expression on his face were those of a
baby just tuning up to cry. But Gaitskill checked
the deluge of tears by his next remark:</p>

<p>“Of course, the chief characteristic of the sport
of kings must not be allowed to die out entirely,
and if a few bets are made on the quiet, it is
nobody’s business. I am sure every darky will
put down a dollar or two just to try his luck.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” Shin Bone grunted, and this time the
tone of his voice and the expression on his face
set Gaitskill to laughing merrily.</p>

<p>“Dat’s de only spote whut will fetch de niggers
to even a free fair, Marse Tom. Dey ain’t comin’
here jes’ to show deir spindle-laig chickens an’ deir
little runt pigs. Dey wants to action aroun’ wid
de ponies.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re right, Shin,” Gaitskill grinned.
“I’ve been going to fairs ever since I was old
enough to stand on the seat and yell, but I never
could get up any interest or enthusiasm for anything
except the slim horses which galloped swiftly
around the circular track.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you spoke de jaw-breakin’ truth!” Shin
Bone applauded. “Eve’y nigger whut comes to
dis fair will hab his cotton-fiel’ pet bang-tailed an’
trained fer de races! Marse Tom, ain’t you got
no cheap, spry-legged hoss you wants to sell me?”</p>

<p>“No!” Gaitskill walked on.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>“Whut ’bout dat pie-faced sorrel, Kunnel?”
Shin persisted, following a few steps behind.</p>

<p>“How many races do you think you could win
with a horse which had been bitten on the leg by a
swamp rattlesnake?” Gaitskill asked disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Not such a many,” Shin remarked, in a disappointed
tone. “Of co’se, dat leg mought git
well&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The horse is ruined, Shin,” Gaitskill told him.
“That leg will always be stiff.”</p>

<p>Shin Bone stopped, watched the colonel until he
turned the corner, then he returned to the gaudy
lithographs and resumed his former position on
the curb, dropping down in an attitude of dejection
and deep meditation.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom oughter had sold me dat hoss,”
he sighed. “My credick wid him oughter be good.
He knows I had plenty money in his bank las’
mont’ an’ drawed it all out to buy dat eatin’-house.
Of co’se, I couldn’t win nothin’ wid dat cripple
hoss, but I might could swap him off fer somepin
dat I <i>could</i> win wid.”</p>

<p>Shin Bone refilled his pipe, dug his heels deeper
in the soft loam of the gutter, rubbed his chin
reflectively, and gazed across the street with
troubled, brooding eyes.</p>

<p>“Dat little gal got me in dis jam,” he announced
finally.</p>

<p>Of course there was a girl in it.</p>

<p>After meeting her, Shin Bone bought a new suit
of clothes, a cake of sweet-scented soap, three white
shirts, and a bankrupt restaurant, fondly hoping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
that personal cleanliness, personal adornment, and
the ownership of property would help him persuade
the girl to make up her mind to live with
him. But alas, the four hundred dollars which he
had in the bank were spent before he got started,
and now the fair was on with a chance to make big
winnings, and Shin Bone was broke!</p>

<p>“Jes’ when I wus gittin’ ready to ax her, I went
bust,” Shin groaned. “Jes’ when she done got her
mind encouraged up to take me, my little dab of
money gib out.”</p>

<p>Yes, Shin needed money.</p>

<p>He began to search his clothes for money, feeling
in every pocket. He brought forth one silver dollar
and one copper cent.</p>

<p>“I didn’t make no new discovery,” he lamented,
as he surveyed his earthly fortune. “I knowed I
had dis money already.”</p>

<p>He placed the dollar on the curb beside him and
laid the copper cent on top of the silver coin, surveying
them disconsolately. Glancing down at his
feet, he observed a tiny red earthworm crawling
in the loam of the gutter. He picked this up and
laid it on top of the copper coin, thus making a
pyramid of his fortune.</p>

<p>“Huh,” he grunted, “I’d rather be a fishin’
worm dan a nigger wid one dollar an’ one cent.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked at the fishing worm with a
new interest. It was twisting and turning upon
the copper coin evidently wishing to get off, but
every time it touched the silver dollar it retreated
to the copper coin again.

<p class="caption">The pie-faced sorrel with the snake-bitten leg.</p></div>

<p>“Dis worm ’pears like it’s skeart of dis dollar,”
Shin muttered.</p>

<p>He flicked the worm into the grass with his
finger nail, slipped his two coins in the upper breast
pocket of his coat, then arose and walked slowly up
the street.</p>

<p>At the nearest corner he met Whiffle Boone,
dressed like a sun-burst, and on her way to the
fair.</p>

<p>“You ain’t lookin’ so powerful peart, Shinny,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Ef I looks like I feels, you better git de sheriff
to put me in a cage,” was Shin’s reply.</p>

<p>“Whut ails you?” the girl inquired solicitously.</p>

<p>“Ef I wus to tell you whut ails me, you’d snicker
right in my face,” Shin Bone declared irritably.
“An’ ef you did, I’d shore spile all de nice clothes
you is got on.”</p>

<p>The girl sniffed and passed on.</p>

<p>“Dar now,” Shin lamented. “I didn’t aim to
start nothin’ wid Whiffle. Dis is shore my onforchnit
day.”</p>

<p>But a moment later Shin forgot all his troubles.</p>

<p>Pap Curtain met him and shook hands with
great cordiality. Pap’s yellow face was a glowing
golden color from excitement, his shifty eyes were
more uncertain than ever, and his sneering mouth
had a still uglier twist.</p>

<p>“Whut you bettin’ on to-day, Shin?” he
whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>“I’s collectin’ tips, Pap,” Shin replied.</p>

<p>“I got a shore thing, Shin,” Pap whispered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
“Three hosses starts in de fourth race. Put yo’
bet on Skipper.”</p>

<p>“I shore thank you fer dem few kind words,
Pap,” Shin declared with delight. “How come
yo’ heart busted open so free?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you figgerin’ on gittin’ married to my
sister’s child?” Pap asked.</p>

<p>“Suttinly.”</p>

<p>“Well, suh, dat’s de reason. But fer Gawd’s
sake, keep de secret in de fambly!”</p>

<h3>II<br />

SKIPPER’S FORM.</h3>

<p>“Dat shore he’ps me a lot,” Shin exulted, as he
started rapidly down the street. “All I’m got to
do is to bet on dat hoss fer a winner.”</p>

<p>Then his rapid gait suddenly ceased, his knees
wabbled weakly, and he leaned against a convenient
picket fence.</p>

<p>“O Lawd,” he groaned. “Dat jes’ makes my
sorrer cut mo’ deeper. I ain’t got no mo’ money to
bet wid now dan I had befo’ I got dat tip!”</p>

<p>Sadly he turned his back to the fair and walked
in the opposite direction, mumbling to himself.</p>

<p>“Dat’s always my luck,” he mourned. “Ef it
rains soup my plate is turned upside down, an’ ef
gold dollars draps down from de sky, I’m shore to
be locked up in jail.”</p>

<p>He passed along the ever-lengthening stream of
negroes going to the races.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>“Look at Shinny goin’ back to dig up some mo’
of his buried money,” was the common greeting
of every group of friends he met. “Somebody is
been talkin’ to Shin about some hoss, an’ tellin’
ain’t no fair!”</p>

<p>Shin scanned every face as a panhandler
watches the crowd on the street looking for some
easy mark from whom he can extract a “temporary”
loan, but there was no face which indicated
that the owner was willing to part with even a
little of his money in behalf of an impecunious
friend. Each one would have promised him all he
wanted&mdash;after the races.</p>

<p>At last Shin met the Rev. Vinegar Atts.</p>

<p>“Elder,” he began, “I think I done got a tail-holt
on somepin’ mighty good an’ I been lookin’ fer
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s right, son,” Vinegar boomed.
“Of co’se, I ain’t no gamblin’ man myse’f, an’
don’t b’lieve in it, but I likes to hear tips so I kin
know whut hoss to watch.”</p>

<p>“Is you got any change on you, elder?” Shin
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“A few, a measly few!” Vinegar rumbled.
“Whut hoss did you say?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t say,” Shin replied.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you bawl out?” Vinegar bellowed.
“I cain’t stand here on my foots all day! Git yo’
mouf gwine!”</p>

<p>“You an’ me oughter make a trade, elder,”
Shin said. “I got de idear an’ you is got de chink.
You gimme all de money you is got, an’ I’ll ’tend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
to dat part of it while you watches de hosses
gallop.”</p>

<p>“I’s skeart you’ll lose my dollars,” Vinegar said
uneasily, fumbling the change in his voluminous
pockets. “Mebbe you better tell me fust whut
kind of tip you is got.”</p>

<p>“Pap Curtain tole me to bet on Skipper in de
fourth race,” Shin said earnestly. “Don’t you
think dat is a good tip?”</p>

<p>Vinegar turned and walked away a few steps,
then turned and walked back. His hands were
thrust deep into his trouser pockets and his chin
was sunk down upon his breast.</p>

<p>“Naw, dat ain’t no good tip a-tall!” he exploded.
“Pap Curtain is a slick-head nigger, as full of tricks
as a monkey wid a tin tail. I don’t hab no trust
in him no-time, no-whar, no-how! You better gib
dat Skipper de go-by.”</p>

<p>“Pap ain’t tryin’ to fool me, Vinegar,” Shin
Bone protested. “I’s gwine marry his sister’s
onlies’ chile, an’ so me an’ him is in de same
fambly. Excusin’ dat, dis Skipper hoss b’longs to
my gal’s maw. Dat proves he ain’t tryin’ to rob
me.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t on to Pap Curtain’s curves yit,
Shin,” Vinegar told him. “Pap would steal de
gold outen his granmaw’s jaw toofs, ef de ole
woman had any toofs in her gums. Excusin’ dat,
Pap don’t expeck you to lose no money. He
knows you ain’t got none.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a fack,” Shin admitted.</p>

<p>“He knowed you would git active an’ succulate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
de tip, “Vinegar told him. “He knowed you’d git
aroun’ an’ try to borrer some money, an’ tell all de
niggers you touched fer a few change whut hoss to
bet on, an’ he knowed dat eve’y nigger in Tickfall
would fall fer de losin’ hoss. I bet Pap’s got all his
money on de yuther hoss right dis minute!”</p>

<p>“I don’t b’lieve Pap would treat me dat way,
Vinegar,” Shin insisted. “He tole me not to tell
nobody, because he wanted to keep de secret in de
fambly.”</p>

<p>“Did he know you wus broke?” Vinegar asked.</p>

<p>“Yep. I tried to borrer some money from him
dis mawnin’.”</p>

<p>“Ef he loves you so awful much, how come he
didn’t loant you some money an’ let you win an’
gib you a start fer de yuther days of racin’?”</p>

<p>“Dat do look like he ain’t actin’ plum’ honest,”
Shin admitted reluctantly. “But, you see, it’s
dis way, Vinegar: niggers wants to manage deir
own money endurin’ of de fair.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s whut I’s gwine do,” Vinegar told him in
a pompous voice. “Dat bait you dangles down in
front my nose am pretty temptin’ to a sucker, but
you done showed me too much of de hook. Excusin’
dat, I jes’ remembers dat I’s been app’inted
de officious starter at de races, an’ shouldn’t oughter
bet on <i>no</i> hoss!”</p>

<p>Vinegar resumed his walk toward the fairgrounds,
leaving Shin Bone to ponder what he had
heard.</p>

<p>“I b’lieves dat Pap Curtain is totin’ fair wid
me,” he concluded at last. “My onlies’ hope is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
to pussuade some yuther nigger to b’lieve de same
way an’ put up de dough. I reckin I better git
busy.”</p>

<p>Shin met Hitch Diamond and presented his
proposition to him. Hitch laughed at him.</p>

<p>“Three hosses starts in dat race, Shin,” Hitch
chuckled. “Doodlebug b’longs to Pap Curtain,
Skipper b’longs to Pap’s sister, an’ de yuther hoss
is de plug whut Prince Total drives to his trash
cart when he cleans up dis town. Now, kin
you tell me which one of Pap’s two hosses is de
winner?”</p>

<p>Shin did not answer.</p>

<p>“I ain’t bettin’ on nothin’ in de fourth race,”
Hitch rumbled, as he walked away. “I ain’t got
spry enough brains to foller Pap’s tricks.”</p>

<p>Time was passing and Shin realized that he must
get some sort of action promptly. He turned
toward the portion of the town occupied by the
whites, and with renewed hope began to solicit
loans from his white friends. After an hour of
activity, running from place to place as busy as a
bird dog, he was in possession of fifty cents, and
had told about fifty different lies to get that
much.</p>

<p>“Dar ain’t but one mo’ hope,” he said, as he
eyed with disgust the handful of nickels he had
accumulated. “Dat hope is Skeeter Butts. Ef
he don’t see de light, den de night is done sottled
down on me shore enough.”</p>

<p>With eager steps he hastened to the Hen-Scratch
saloon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<h3>III<br />

DEEP LAID PLANS.</h3>

<p>Shin found Skeeter Butts sitting behind the bar
in the Hen-Scratch saloon counting a roll of soiled
and poisonous-looking money. The sight gladdened
the eyes of the poverty-stricken negro.</p>

<p>“Skeeter,” he exulted, “dat little wad of money
shows dat you an’ me is gwine to git rich.”</p>

<p>“How come?” Skeeter asked. “You ain’t got
no claimance on dis wad.”</p>

<p>“I’se got one real good tip.”</p>

<p>“Explode it in my y-ear,” Skeeter exclaimed
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Pap Curtain say bet on Skipper.”</p>

<p>Skeeter grinned, snickered, chuckled, laughed.
He stood up, turned around, sat down again, and
laughed louder.</p>

<p>“Ain’t dat no good tip?” Shin asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s a dandy,” Skeeter proclaimed.
“All dat tip signifies to me is, don’t lose no money
on Skipper.”</p>

<p>“You don’t onderstan’ ’bout dis, Skeeter,” Shin
said earnestly. “You see, I is about to marrify
into Pap Curtain’s fambly, an’ he jes’ passed me de
news fer my own good.”</p>

<p>“Who is you gwine take on?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>“Dat little charcoal blonde named Whiffle
Boone,” Shin told him. “An’ dis Skipper hoss
belongs to her maw.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” Skeeter grunted. “Mebbe dat’s diffunt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
an’ mebbe not. How much change is you got to
bet?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got none,” Shin replied sadly. “I
wants to borrer a leetle. I’ll gib you a owe-bill
agin’ my eatin’-house ef you’ll loant me some.”</p>

<p>Skeeter weighed this for a minute, then said:</p>

<p>“Us’ll fix it dis way, Shin: I’ll loant you fifty
dollars on yo’ eatin’-house, pervided you’ll let me
handle de money an’ manage de bets. I jes’
nachelly hates to pass out money to anodder
coon.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s all right, Skeeter,” Shin declared, a
burden lifted from his heart. “All I wants is a
chance to win.”</p>

<p>“I’s gittin’ ready to close up right now, “Skeeter
said, as he reached for his hat. “Us’ll mosey out
to de track togedder.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They entered the gate to find the grounds
thronged with happy, eager, black faces, shiny with
sweat. The band was playing, the peanut roasters
were shrieking, and dozens of apron-clad, thunder-voiced
negroes waved long-handled forks and
howled like a wolf-pack. “Hot&mdash;hot&mdash;hot-dog!”</p>

<p>“Lawdy,” Shin sighed. “My empty stomick is
wrapped aroun’ my backbone like a wet dishrag
aroun’ a dryin’-pole. I feel like I ain’t et fer fawty
days!”</p>

<p>He promptly separated himself from Skeeter
Butts and lost no time in finding Whiffle Boone.</p>

<p>“Is you had somepin to eat sence you got out
here, Whiffle?” he asked eagerly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p>“I ain’t got nothin’ but a smell of dem hot
dogs,” she smiled.</p>

<p>“Dis is whar we chews a few,” Shin declared, as
he led her away from the grandstand.</p>

<p>“Whut wus you so snippy about when I met you
uptown?” Whiffle inquired as they consumed the
sausage which Shin purchased with the money he
had begged from the white folks of Tickfall.</p>

<p>“I wus figgerin’ on how to git a bet down on a
winnin’ hoss, honey,” Shin laughed. “It ’peared
like I couldn’t make de riffle, an’ when I seed you
I had on one of dese here grouches.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t it about time you wus bustin’ de news?”
Whiffle asked. “Cain’t you tell me de name of de
hoss?”</p>

<p>“No’m,” Shin grinned. “I done promise I
wouldn’t say no words. But ef you wait fer me
atter de races is over I’ll take you to a real eatin’-house
an’ us’ll celebrate our winnin’s. We ain’t
fur from gittin’ married now an’ I’s savin’ somepin
fer a surprise.”</p>

<p>The gong sounded at the starter’s shed, and
Whiffle and Shin walked toward the grandstand,
eating hot sausage as they went.</p>

<p>“Whut race is dis, Whiffle?” Shin inquired.</p>

<p>“Dis is de fourth,” Whiffle told him. “My
uncle Pap Curtain is got a couple hosses in dis
race.”</p>

<p>Shin Bone promptly lost his appetite.</p>

<p>“Lawd,” he exclaimed. “I asked Skeeter
Butts to put a few money on dis race fer me. I
hope he is got time.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>“Plenty time,” Whiffle declared. “De ponies
ain’t come out on de track yit.”</p>

<p>At that moment Shin saw Skeeter Butts sliding
eel-like through a dense crowd without touching
an elbow. A few minutes later he saw Skeeter
again, talking earnestly to certain dressy, furtive
persons, bearing every evidence of being visitors
from New Orleans, and these men displayed tiny
celluloid slates on which were penciled various
fractions after the name of each horse.</p>

<p>Three horses galloped up the track and Shin
looked them over carefully, concluding that the
horse which carried his money was the only race-horse
of the three. Trailer was a clumsy plow-horse;
Doodlebug was a Tuckapoo mustang with
an ugly temper; Skipper alone had the long, grayhound
lines of the real racer.</p>

<p>“Whut hoss is you got yo’ money on, Shin?”
Whiffle asked.</p>

<p>“I bets on Skipper.”</p>

<p>“My gosh!” the girl exclaimed, staring at him
with big eyes. “Is you done loss all yo’ good
sense?”</p>

<p>“Pap Curtain tole me to bet on Skipper,” Shin
said defensively.</p>

<p>“Pap is like a mule, Shin,” Whiffle said sadly.
“He wucks bofe ways. You gotter look out fer
surprises when you monkeys wid Pap.”</p>

<p>The band stopped playing, the intense silence of
the people was broken by the sound of pounding
hoofs, and the horses swept under the wire.</p>

<p>“Go!” Vinegar Atts bellowed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>The blood pounded in the temples of Shin Bone,
and he suddenly felt dizzy, almost delirious. Then
he sat down, gasping like a landed fish. Doodlebug
was three lengths ahead, running with the ease
and regularity of a watch.</p>

<p>Skipper was dropping behind without even a
symptom of a rally. At the half-mile post, Skipper
was slowing up some more, showing weariness.
Slower and slower he got in spite of the frantic
efforts of his jockey to extract some speed from his
mount’s system.</p>

<p>Fairly stunned, Shin sat down and waited for the
end. After what seemed to him an age or two,
Doodlebug came under the wire, and a yellow,
freckled-faced negro boy with an inadequate
knowledge of spelling climbed a short ladder and
inscribed upon a blackboard the names of the three
horses in the order of their places in the race:</p>

<p class="table">
DUDDLEBUG<br />
TRAYLOR<br />
SKIPER<br />
</p>

<p>There was a little scattering applause, but the
crowd could get up no enthusiasm for such an
exhibition, and few had bet upon a race in which
the tricky Pap Curtain had entered two horses.</p>

<p>Whiffle Boone turned and glared at Shin, who
sat dazed and crumpled on the bench.</p>

<p>“Wus dat de news you wus gwine bust to me as a
surprise, Shin?” she demanded sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, honey,” Shin said gloomily, as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
rose to his feet and staggered toward the exit. “I
ain’t in no mind to argufy about surprises now. I
done got one myse’f.”</p>

<p>“Whut ’bout dat supper we wus gwine hab?”
Whiffle asked.</p>

<p>“Honey, I couldn’t buy a sandsquich wid a bad
dime,” Shin told her tearfully. “I ain’t got
nothin’ dat even looks like money.”</p>

<h3>IV<br />

THE LAME SORREL.</h3>

<p>Shin hunted all over the fair grounds for Skeeter
Butts without being able to find him.</p>

<p>“I knows whut ails dat nigger,” he said to himself,
at last. “He’s done gone back to de Hen-Scratch
an’ he’s waitin’ fer me to come. I ain’t
gwine! Dar ain’t nothin’ mo’ fer me to win but a
argumint. I done made dat nigger lose all his
money an’ if he gits me shet up in dat saloon, he’ll
kill me.”</p>

<p>He walked out of the gate and went straight to
the bank, knocking upon the door of the president’s
office.</p>

<p>A voice within answered, and Shin turned the
knob and entered.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom,” he began, “ain’t you got no job
fer a strong, willin’ nigger?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Colonel Gaitskill said. “But I don’t
believe any nigger is willing to work while a free
fair is going on out at the race-track.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>“I done got enough fair, Marse Tom,” Shin said
solemnly. “I loves hosses, but I ain’t wise to
nothin’ about ’em excusin’ how to feed ’em, water
’em, an’ rub ’em down.”</p>

<p>“You wanted me to sell you a race-horse this
morning,” Gaitskill reminded him smilingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. But you knowed I didn’t had no
money to pay fer no hoss,” Shin grinned. “I wus
jes’ talkin’ wid my mouf. But I shore would like
to hab a job wuckin’ wid hosses.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Gaitskill agreed. “Go out and
potter around my stable. Three dollars a week
and feed.”</p>

<p>“Thank ’e, suh. Dat shore suits fine.”</p>

<p>“And listen, Shin. Go out to the bayou pasture
and bring in that pie-faced sorrel you wanted to
buy. That’s a good saddler. See if you can
doctor him up some way and limber up that snake-bitten
leg.”</p>

<p>Shin had to pass along the road which led to the
Hen-Scratch saloon on his way to the bayou pasture,
but he took a wide detour when he came to
that place of danger, walking through the fields
until he came back to the road at a bend a half mile
further on.</p>

<p>Slipping a bridle on the crippled horse, he leaped
lightly upon his back, and rode toward the gate.
The weeds grew rank and high in that rich bottom
land, and multitudes of insects arose from the
vegetation and whirled around the heads of the
horse and his rider.</p>

<p>Suddenly a large grasshopper whirred up from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the weeds and flew past the sorrel’s ear with a
sharp, rattling, whining sound&mdash;“Zee-e-e-e.”</p>

<p>With a snort of fright the horse sprang forward
and ran like a rabbit all around the field, while Shin
yelled and wrenched at the bridle, and begged the
sorrel to “Whoa!”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the sorrel spilled Shin off and
ran far back into the woods.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when Shin captured him again
and rode back to Tickfall. The long run had made
the horse lame.</p>

<p>Passing the Hen-Scratch saloon, Shin tried to get
a little more speed out of his steed, but the crippled
brute merely groaned and limped on. Then right
in front of the saloon an accident happened.</p>

<p>There was a new picket fence built around the
yard of a home across the street from the saloon.
A little negro boy ran down the street with a stick
in his hand, and as he passed this fence, he laid his
stick against the pickets, scraping it along as he
ran. A horrible, rattling noise was the result.</p>

<p>At the first sound, Shin’s pie-faced sorrel leaped
into the air, threw Shin heavily to the ground, and
ran snorting with fright toward the Gaitskill home
with the speed of a deer.</p>

<p>A crowd quickly gathered around the prostrate
Shin Bone, and he was picked up and carried into
the Hen-Scratch saloon. A few minutes later,
after sufficient liquor had been spilled down his
throat and over his dusty clothes, Shin opened his
eyes and gazed into the yellow, grinning face of
Skeeter Butts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>“I figgered it wus about time you wus comin’
here so us could divide up, Shin,” Skeeter laughed.
“But I’s plum’ sorry you got throwed off.”</p>

<p>“I cain’t divide up nothin’,” Shin said sadly.
“Of co’se I’ll sottle my owe-bill wid you jes’ as
soon as I kin. I done got me a job wid Marse
Tom. But I ain’t got nary cent of money now.”</p>

<p>“I ’speck you is got mo’ dan you figger on,”
Skeeter laughed. “How much does you s’pose
you winned on dat race?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t winned nothin’,” Shin declared.
“Skipper lose.”</p>

<p>“Shorely,” Skeeter agreed. “I knowed he wus
gwine do dat all along. So I bet yo’ money an’ my
money on Doodlebug!”</p>

<p>“Bless gracious!” Shin howled, sitting up in the
middle of the floor and gazing into the faces of
the grinning negroes who stood in a ring about
him. “How much did you rake down?”</p>

<p>“Yo’ win is one hundred dollars,” Skeeter
declared exultantly. “But you owes me fifty
an’ I takes dat out of yo’ win.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Shin laughed. “Hand me over
dem dollars.”</p>

<p>He sat down at the table and counted the money
laboriously, his manner becoming more and more
elated as the dollars piled up under his hand.
Then he slipped the wad into his pocket, and
beamed upon the circle of admiring friends.</p>

<p>“Good luck done kotch me agin, niggers!”
he laughed. Then he slipped behind the bar beside
Skeeter, and said:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

<p>“Skeeter, you hab done me a large amount of
great good.”</p>

<p>“I don’t deeserve no credick,” Skeeter laughed.
“I jes’ happened to know Pap Curtain, an’ besides
dat, I done expe’unce dat little Tuckapoo mustang
named Doodlebug befo’. I monkeyed wid dat
pony one time, an’ Skeeter wus a well skint
sucker.”</p>

<p>“Pap hadn’t oughter did me dat way,” Shin
lamented.</p>

<p>“Pap cain’t ack no diffunt,” Skeeter told him.
“Some niggers is like snakes. Dey gotter wiggle
an’ twist an’ go crooked to git along.”</p>

<p>“I shore wish I could gib Pap a twist dat he ain’t
lookin’ fer,” Shin declared.</p>

<p>Skeeter eyed him a moment with intense interest.
Then he asked:</p>

<p>“Whut you gwine do wid dat money?”</p>

<p>“I’ll ack like eve’y nigger&mdash;spend it!” Shin
laughed.</p>

<p>“I figger on buyin’ a race-hoss wid my win,”
Skeeter suggested. “How would dat plan suit
you wid yo’ money?”</p>

<p>“You reckin I could git a hoss whut’ll beat Pap’s
Doodlebug?” Shin asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Skeeter assured him. “Doodlebug
ain’t such a much hoss. Of co’se, he kin beat
dese here old plow-hosses whut runs agin him. I
knows de hoss whut kin beat him right now.”</p>

<p>Shin pulled his roll of money out of his pocket
and passed it back.</p>

<p>“Buy me dat hoss, Skeeter,” he said earnestly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
“I don’t want nothin’ as bad as I want to git Pap
Curtain’s goat!”</p>

<h3>V<br />

NIGGER BLACKIE.</h3>

<p>Shin Bone tended bar for Skeeter Butts until
eleven o’clock that night, then Skeeter returned
to the Hen-Scratch saloon, covered with swamp
mud and leading a slim black horse.</p>

<p>“Dis is yo’ winner, Shin,” he said in weary
tones, as he placed the lead-rope into the hands
of the pop-eyed owner. “I got him for fifty
dollars cash down, an’ he’s shore a dandy.”</p>

<p>“He looks pretty peart,” Shin grinned. “Kin
he run?”</p>

<p>“Yep,” Skeeter said in a disgusted tone. “He
kin run like a log raff floatin’ <i>up</i> de Massassap’
River. But us ain’t winnin’ on his speed&mdash;us is
bettin’ on his looks.”</p>

<p>“I don’t ketch on ’bout dis,” Shin said stupidly.
“Dis sounds to me like you done waste my
money.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go by sound, Shin,” Skeeter snickered.
“Go by looks. Now listen to dis few advices: you
waste all de rest of dis night scourin’ down dis
hoss wid a currycomb, a brush, an’ a rag. As soon
as it is good day, you git out on de race-track an’
lope dis hoss aroun’ fer a while. Ef Pap Curtain
is out on de track, you show him how good dis
hoss kin pufform.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<p>Shin walked away, mumbling to himself in his
perplexity. But he took the horse to Gaitskill’s
stable and followed Skeeter’s advice. After five or
six hours of the most arduous labor, Shin lifted his
lantern and surveyed the animal. He shone like
a new silver dollar, every hair was in place, and the
horse was beautiful.</p>

<p>“He shore is a looker,” Shin proclaimed. “I
hopes he’s got some speed inside his black
hide.”</p>

<p>A little later, Shin rode him slowly out to the
fairgrounds and entered the gate. It was just
after daybreak, but early as it was, as Shin rode
onto the track, he encountered Pap Curtain
mounted on Doodlebug.</p>

<p>Without a word they started around in the same
direction, each man watching the other’s horse
with great interest.</p>

<p>Shin broke from a canter into a swinging gallop,
and Pap followed with Doodlebug. By the time
they had gone half a mile and had pulled up, Pap
knew all about the black horse.</p>

<p>“Did you buy dat hoss wid de money you
winned on de fourth race yistiddy, Shin?” Pap
asked with a sneering grin.</p>

<p>“Naw,” Shin said shortly. “You tole me to bet
on Skipper.”</p>

<p>“Skipper skipped aroun’ consid’able fast fer
him,” Pap chuckled. “Somebody must hab felt
sorry fer you an’ gib you dat hoss to win yo’ losin’s
back wid.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s perzackly whut dey done,” Shin replied.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
“I’ll take some of dat money back now ef you is
willin’ to try a private race.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t been made acquaintance wid dat hoss,”
Pap objected.</p>

<p>“Is you ’quainted wid ten dollars?” Shin asked
in an ugly tone, as he pulled a bill from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Sho’ly, sho’ly,” Pap proclaimed in unctuous
tones. “Us’ll ride back to’des de gran’stan’ an’
you kin han’ dat money to de fust coon you meet.
I’ll put a ten on top of it.”</p>

<p>Deep joy filled Pap’s heart as he watched the
black horse walking beside his own Tuckapoo
mustang, the little racer which had never been
beaten when Pap wanted him to win. Ten dollars
was a great deal of money in Pap’s mind, and
easily won.</p>

<p>“You double criss-crossed me on dat race yistiddy,
Pap,” Shin said angrily. “You made out
like I wus a member of de fambly an’ you wus
he’pin’ me along. Whut you wus plannin’ wus to
rob me of all my loose change.”</p>

<p>“How much did you drap, Shin?” Pap snickered.</p>

<p>“I drapped eve’y cent I bet on Skipper,” Shin
said non-committally.</p>

<p>“Ain’t dat too bad!” Pap sighed mockingly.
“You is gwine drap a few mo’ change, too.”</p>

<p>A moon-faced negro sat on the fence near the
starter’s stand, waiting for something to happen.</p>

<p>“Hold dis money, pardner!” Pap said, as he
extended his hand with ten dollars. “Dis little
Shin Bone wants to lose a bet!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>Shin dropped his bill into the eager stake-holder’s
hand, and turned his horse to ride a few
feet up the track for a start. The moon-faced
negro took his place under the starter’s wire and
the two horses loped down the track.</p>

<p>“Go!” the stakeholder whooped.</p>

<p>It was a pretty race for a quarter and the black
was putting forth his best effort every foot of the
way. Then Shin’s horse seemed to lose all interest
in the race and all other affairs of life and the utmost
efforts of the rider availed only to bring the
horse under the wire about fifty yards behind
Doodlebug.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, po’ little, las’ little ten dollar bill!”
Shin chanted tearfully as he loped tearfully on
toward the stable leaving Pap Curtain to collect the
stakes.</p>

<p>But Pap was not disposed to let Shin off so
easily. He galloped after him and began:</p>

<p>“Whut race is you gwine start dat cow in, Shin?”</p>

<p>“He runs in eve’y race whut Doodlebug has,
Pap,” Shin said easily enough, but his heart was
filled with chagrin. “I bought him to beat yo’
Doodlebug!”</p>

<p>“Doodlebug is in de secont race to-day,” Pap
chuckled. “You shore owns a good-looker, but as
a race-hoss dat shiny black is a puffeckly awful
arrangement.”</p>

<p>This was Shin Bone’s idea exactly, and he rode
out of the fairgrounds and hitched his horse in
front of the Hen-Scratch saloon to hold an executive
session with Skeeter Butts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>He strode into the saloon like a personified calamity,
and dropped down in a chair beside the
table where Skeeter sat.</p>

<p>“Skeeter,” he howled, “you shore made a
awful miscue about dat Nigger Blackie hoss you
bought fer me. He’s so nigh nothin’ dat nobody
cain’t tell de diffunce betwix’ him <i>an’</i> nothin’!”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so,” Skeeter replied, continuing to
count some money he had spread out on the
table. “Dat’s a dandy lookin’ hoss.”</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Shin retorted bitterly. “He’s a
looker, but he runs like a lan’ tarrapin travelin’
in a plowed field.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t it awful!” Skeeter snickered. “I’d
druther try to win a race ridin’ straddle of a mud
scow whut I borrered outen de ribber dan to put
up dat hoss fer a winner.”</p>

<p>Shin grunted and relapsed into an outraged
silence, looking at the unperturbed Skeeter now
and then with glaring eyes. Finally Skeeter
asked:</p>

<p>“Did you gib Nigger Blackie a tryout?”</p>

<p>“Yep. An’ I loss de onlies’ ten dollars I’m got
in de worl’ tryin’ to beat Pap’s Doodlebug.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s whut I loant you dat ten fer,” Skeeter
said, handing Shin ten dollars more from the pile
on the table. “Ef you hadn’t lost it, I’d ’a’ fit
you!”</p>

<p>“Huh,” Shin grunted. “You ain’t tellin’ me
as much as I oughter know.”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, not quite as much. You see, you’s
gwine marry into Pap’s fambly, an’ you’s got one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
of dese here open-work minds an’ cain’t keep
nothin’ secret.”</p>

<p>“Dat ain’t no reason why I don’t want to rob
Pap of all his dollars,” Shin declared belligerently.
“But I don’t expeck to git much of Pap’s money
wis Nigger Blackie to run fer it.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe you didn’t know how to ride him,
Shin,” Skeeter suggested.</p>

<p>“’Taint dat, Skeeter,” Bone said earnestly.
“Dat hoss jes’ nachelly ain’t got no speed in
him.”</p>

<p>“I’s heerd tell dat he had racin’ blood in him,”
Skeeter replied.</p>

<p>“Mebbe so, he did had&mdash;one time,” Shin
responded gloomily. “But a stable flea bit him an’
got it all.”</p>

<p>Skeeter stood up and reached for his hat.</p>

<p>“I’s glad to git dat repote from you, Shin,” he
said. “Now I wants you to tend dis bar fer me
till I gits back. I’s gwine ride Nigger Blackie
aroun’ a little an’ see kin I limber up his racin’
speed.”</p>

<h3>VI<br />

BY THREE LENGTHS.</h3>

<p>On the morning of the second day of the Tickfall
Negro Fair, Colonel Tom Gaitskill, the chief promoter
of the negro uplift movement, received a
shock.</p>

<p>A delegation of wailing women waited upon him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
and tearfully told their tale of woe. All the
canned fruits and vegetables, all the preserves
and jams, all the cakes and pies which they had
brought to the Fair and entered in the competition
for prizes had disappeared from the hall!</p>

<p>Investigation revealed the fact that the hungry
negroes had helped themselves, sampling everything
until nothing of the sample remained.</p>

<p>Half an hour later a delegation of negro farmers
waited upon the Colonel and informed him that all
their potatoes, cabbages, fruit, and home-raised
peanuts, along with their sugar cane, corn, and hay
had mysteriously disappeared from the display hall!</p>

<p>Investigation revealed the fact that those who
had animals on exhibition on the grounds had
looted and foraged, and found the supply insufficient
for their needs.</p>

<p>A committee of howling negro girls waited upon
Colonel Gaitskill and announced that all their
plain and fancy sewing, their scarfs and handkerchiefs,
their dresses and towels had disappeared!</p>

<p>Fowl raisers came to complain that their chickens,
ducks, geese, and turkeys had vanished, some
or all of them, and what could they do about it?</p>

<p>“By George!” Gaitskill exclaimed in exasperation.
“These niggers don’t have to be taught
any uplift. They’ve lifted everything on the fairgrounds
and made away with it.”</p>

<p>Nothing was left on the grounds but the race-horses,
and the Uplift Committee of white citizens
of Tickfall decided to charge admission to
the grounds for the last two days of the racing, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
by the money thus received reimburse the farmers
and their wives and daughters for their losses.
Thus peace and happiness were restored.</p>

<p>The afternoon was bright and fair and Pap
Curtain was on the track early with a careful eye
upon Doodlebug and upon all the other horses in
Doodlebug’s race, the second. He made a special
inspection of Nigger Blackie as the jockey, Little
Bit, rode him up the track for a warming. The
black was as clumsy as a cow, and the diminutive
darky rode him awkwardly and fearfully.</p>

<p>None of the ordinary rules and regulations were
in force upon this race-track. A jockey could ride
with any sort of saddle, or without one. The
negroes had no uniforms, carried any sort of whips
or spurs which they thought would get speed from
their mounts. Only one rule was positively
enforced, and that was made for this event: the
man who entered a horse for a race must own the
horse.</p>

<p>Pap was at the stable when Little Bit rode back,
and he greeted the little jockey in a tone which
already thrilled with anticipated victory.</p>

<p>“Don’t bet no chink on dat sook-cow, Little
Bit,” he snickered. “Ef you got any loose change,
buy yo’se’f a bernaner&mdash;don’t waste it!”</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts overheard this remark and hastened
forward.</p>

<p>“No jockey kin ride my hoss wid a bettin’-ticket
in his hat, Pap,” he said positively. “Ef
you wants to lose yo’ money, lemme take it away
from you.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

<p>“I thought dis hoss b’longed to Shin Bone,”
Pap remarked.</p>

<p>“He do,” Skeeter assured him. “Me an’ Shin
went cahoots, an’ Shin exoncised dis hoss dis
mawnin’.”</p>

<p>“I remember ’bout dat,” Pap chuckled, as he
produced a roll of money from his pocket. “Less
go down to de gramstan’ an’ git a stakeholder fer
dese funds.”</p>

<p>Skeeter took all the money which Pap would
bet, then he walked to the betting shed where a
howling mass of half-intoxicated negroes demonstrated
an intense love for the improvement of
stock.</p>

<p>Ten big, hoarse-voiced, fat-necked negro gamblers
from New Orleans pushed and bellowed among
the darkies with their little celluloid slates, taking
bets for any amount on the favorite, Doodlebug.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond, Prince Total, and Figger Bush
closed in upon Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p>“I hear tell you is got a hoss in de nex’ race,
Skeeter,” Hitch Diamond rumbled.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, I’s gibin’ him a leetle tryout,” Skeeter
replied modestly. “Dis here race-hoss game is
kinder new on me, an’ I’s jes’ tryin’ to break in
easy-like. I buyed a race hoss yistiddy in Shongaloon
from Tax Sambola.”</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” Hitch exclaimed. “You ain’t
bettin’ money on him, is yer?”</p>

<p>“Jes’ a leetle to keep up my mind int’rusted,”
Skeeter grinned.</p>

<p>“I hopes it ain’t no mo’ dan you kin affode to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
lose, Skeeter,” Hitch Diamond said earnestly.
“Dat Nigger Blackie hoss is de best looker in de
worl’, an’ he ack like he’s gittin’ ready to go over de
land like a air-ship. But he don’t run no faster
dan a sewin’-machine.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t it de truth!” Skeeter laughed mockingly.
“I figger I better bet on his looks instid of his
gait!”</p>

<p>Skeeter walked away and Hitch Diamond turned
to his friends with eyes which glowed like a lion’s.</p>

<p>“Sell yo’ socks offen yo’ foots an’ bet yo’ money
on Doodlebug, niggers,” he howled. “Skeeter
Butts is done commit hisse’f enough to disavow dis
Nigger Blackie hoss complete!”</p>

<p>When the bell rang for the second race, Skeeter
Butts found Shin Bone in the grandstand, leaning
against the rail.</p>

<p>“I got all our spondulix down, Shin,” he grinned.
“Bofe of us bets fifty dollars per each.”</p>

<p>“How wus de odds?” Shin asked in a tone
trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>“Some of it wus five to one,” Skeeter replied.
“All I bet Pap wus at dem odds.”</p>

<p>“Dat’ll bust him in about six minutes,” Shin
laughed. “By dark, he’ll be cryin’ in dat lace
handkerchief he swiped outen de show-hall an’
beggin’ me to marrify his niece so he won’t hab to
suppote her no mo’.”</p>

<p>Shin turned and gazed at the crowd, trying
to locate his girl. Failing to find her, he left
Skeeter without ceremony.</p>

<p>Nigger Blackie came in front of the grandstand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
loping along as sedately as a man might walk
across a drawing-room. Little Bit, sitting on his
back without a saddle was as nervous as a cat in the
midst of a pack of popping fire-crackers.</p>

<p>“I bet ten to one dat Little Bit falls offen dat
pony befo’ he gits to de quarter pole,” Pap
proclaimed with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Ef Nigger Blackie runs in form, he ain’t gwine
git to no quarter pole onless Little Bit hauls him
dar in a wheel-barrer,” Hitch Diamond grinned.</p>

<p>“Dar’s Doodlebug!” Pap proclaimed, in the
tone of a parent speaking of a noble son.</p>

<p>Doodlebug was a Tuckapoo mustang. To those
acquainted with the breed, enough said. It
means that Doodlebug was a mean, tricky, biting,
kicking, balky Indian pony. He came up the
track sideways, backwards, on his hind feet, on his
fore feet. Twice he lay down and rolled over, and
once he balked, spending two minutes in a vain
effort to bite off his jockey’s leg.</p>

<p>“Dat hoss ain’t got but one good p’int, Hitchie,”
Pap declared. “He kin run like a bullet
shot outen a gun!”</p>

<p>A few minutes later five horses swept down the
track in an even line.</p>

<p>“Go!” yelled Vinegar Atts, up in the judges’
stand.</p>

<p>In the momentary silence following the get-away,
there was a scream so loud and ear-splitting
that it thrilled every person on the fair-grounds.
Then everybody on the grandstand stood up and
an astonished exclamation leaped from every lip:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>“Look at Nigger Blackie!” “My Lawd, how
dat hoss do run!”</p>

<p>Little Bit had a fence picket for a whip. But
instead of using it in the ordinary way, he was
violating all the customs of race-riding. He sat
perfectly straight, his bridle-reins were untouched,
lying upon the horse’s neck and flapping loosely
around his face, while he waved his fence picket
around his head like a club. Nigger Blackie was
running like a streak.</p>

<p>As Little Bit passed the half-mile post, once
more that thrilling, ear-splitting shriek swept
across the intervening space to the people who
stood breathless in the grandstand.</p>

<p>“Whut kind of noise is dat Little Bit is makin’
wid his mouf?” Pap Curtain inquired uneasily as
he watched Doodlebug a full length behind Nigger
Blackie, running his best and unable to gain an
inch.</p>

<p>“Dat’s a Indian war-whoop, Pap,” Hitch
Diamond said in a voice which choked in his
throat. “When I wus jes’ a little shaver, I used
to hear de Caddo Indians yelp dat way when dey
wus hoss-racin’.”</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” Pap exclaimed, as the horses
turned into the home-stretch. “Whut’s done
happened to Doodlebug?”</p>

<p>Doodlebug was doing his best, but he was two
lengths behind, while Little Bit was riding Nigger
Blackie like an Indian, whooping like a calliope, and
Nigger Blackie, with the loose bridle-reins flapping
around his face, was coming in like a rocket.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

<p>Somebody pulled at Pap’s shoulder, and a soft
voice spoke pleadingly in his ear. He struck
behind him savagely with his clenched fist, and
then leaned far over the fence.</p>

<p>Suddenly the grandstand broke out into a prayer,
a wailing cry which urged, pleaded, implored!</p>

<p>“<i>Come</i> on, Doodlebug! <i>Come on, Doodlebug!</i>
Come <i>on</i>, Doodlebug!”</p>

<p>“COME on, <i>Doodlebug</i>!” Pap shrieked, with
tears in his eyes, and agony in his voice, and
tragedy in his heart. “Oh, fer <i>Gawd</i>lemighty’s
sake, come on!”</p>

<p>Again some one pulled at Pap’s arm, and a
pleading voice spoke to him. Again Pap savagely
shook himself loose, struck out blindly and insanely
at the person behind him.</p>

<p>Then a mighty moaning sound broke from the
grandstand, the lamentation of a crushed, disappointed,
bankrupted multitude.</p>

<p>Nigger Blackie was under the wire, a winner
by three lengths!</p>

<p>Pap Curtain turned away from the track,
dazed, nauseated, his yellow cheeks streaked with
white, his sneering lips hanging loosely and
quivering, his mouth as dry as sawdust, his tongue
feeling like it was as big and rough as a door-mat.</p>

<p>Once more some one pulled at Pap’s shoulder,
and a pleading voice spoke tearfully:</p>

<p>“Oh, Pap! I been lookin’ fer you eve’ywhar!
I was tryin’ to kotch you an’ tip you off!”</p>

<p>“Whut’s dat?” Pap asked, turning his dazed,
unseeing eyes upon the girl.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p>Whiffle Boone began to cry.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t find you till atter de race begun,
Pap,” she sobbed. “I wanted to tell you dat
Skeeter Butts an’ Shin Bone swapped hosses on
you.”</p>

<p>“How’s dat?” Pap asked, stupidly.</p>

<p>“Skeeter bought two black hosses yistiddy,
Pap,” Whiffle Boone said impatiently, mopping
the tears from her face. “He got one from Tax
Sambola at Shongaloon, but de hoss whut winned
de race wus dat black hoss whut Indian Turtle
owned&mdash;dat ole Indian whut lives on de Coolie
bayo. Dat’s how come Little Bit rid him jes’ like
a Indian!”</p>

<p>Pap leaned weakly against the fence and a deep
moan issued from his stiff, parched lips.</p>

<p>“It’s too late now, Whiffle,” he sighed. “I
done loss eve’y dollar I owns. I bet dat fifty
dollars whut you gib me to keep fer you, an’ I
done lost dat. I done bet Doodlebug, an’ lost
him! I would hab loss Skipper, too, only but he
b’longed to yo’ maw instid of me!”</p>

<p>Whiffle suddenly broke out into a happy laugh.</p>

<p>“When do Skipper run again, Pap?” she
inquired.</p>

<p>“He starts in de fifth race,” Pap sighed.</p>

<p>“All right, Pap, don’t cry!” Whiffle giggled.
“Skipper will win in de fifth race&mdash;you leave dat
to me!”</p>

<p>“’Twon’t do no good, Whiffle,” Pap moaned
despairingly. “Us ain’t got no money to bet.”</p>

<p>“You leave dat to me, too,” Whiffle replied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
confidently. “You set down somewheres an’
rest yo’ mind an’ pick up a brave heart. I’ll git
some money fer you to bet, an’ I’ll fry Skeeter
Butts an’ Shin Bone in deir own grease!”</p>

<h3>VII<br />

DOPE.</h3>

<p>In the rear of the grandstand Skeeter Butts
and Shin Bone were holding a jubilee. They were
in possession of more money than they had ever
imagined was in the world. Silver and currency
caused every pocket to bulge, and for the first
time in their lives they felt the need of police
protection.</p>

<p>“I’s skeart dese niggers will stick me up an’ rob
me of dis money, Skeeter,” Shin said uneasily.
“Wut is us gwine do wid it?”</p>

<p>“Bet it agin!” Skeeter exclaimed exultantly.
“Pap Curtain is gwine run Skipper in de las’ race.
Dat means dat you an’ me will go home wid all de
money on de fairground.”</p>

<p>“We ain’t gwine git many bets,” Shin grinned.
“Dese here niggers ain’t got much mo’ money.
Us is copped it all.”</p>

<p>“Only three hosses starts in de fifth race, Shin,”
Skeeter remarked. “One is Prince Total’s plow-hoss;
one is Pap’s Skipper, an’ de yuther is a good
runner called Peedee. Us bets on Peedee.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Shin agreed. “Less git busy.
Nothin’ don’t bother me but my money.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p>“Less go somewhar an’ ’vide up our money
even!” Skeeter suggested. “Over by de pond
would be a good hidin’ place!”</p>

<p>As they started around the grandstand they met
Pap and Whiffle Boone. Pap was walking with
bent shoulders, and seemed to have aged forty
years in a few minutes. Whiffle was leading him
by the hand, and the dazed and broken negro was
mumbling incoherently to himself. Whiffle looked
straight at Shin Bone without a sign of recognition,
and her eyes were like icicles.</p>

<p>“Dar now, Shin!” Skeeter exclaimed tragically.
“You done busted Pap an’ yo’ love scrape, bofe at
de same time.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t cryin’,” Shin grinned easily. “Whiffle
knows whar de money is at, an’ she’ll come back to
little Shinny.”</p>

<p>They watched Pap and the girl until they were
swallowed up by the crowd, then Skeeter and
Shin crossed the track and walked over to a pond
in the rear of the judges’ stand. They sat down on
the edge of the water, divided their fortune, and
happily planned their final raid on the money of
their friends.</p>

<p>In the meantime Pap and Whiffle were standing
at a stall looking into the face of a sleepy-eyed
horse named Skipper.</p>

<p>“How much would you bet on Skipper, ef
you had some money, Pap?” Whiffle wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” Pap replied disgustedly.</p>

<p>Whiffle turned and caught Pap by the lapel of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
his coat. She looked straight into his eyes and
said:</p>

<p>“Pap, you listen to me: I win one hundred
dollars in dat las’ race by bettin’ on Nigger Blackie.
Dat shows dat I knows more about hoss-racin’ dan
you does. Now, you take dis money an’ bet eve’y
cent of it on Skipper, an’ leave de rest to me&mdash;will
you do dat?”</p>

<p>Pap’s sagging backbone stiffened. His chin
came up in the air. His air of disappointment and
dejection vanished like magic, and his face assumed
a broad smile.</p>

<p>“Gimme dat money, honey,” he exulted. “I
ain’t mournin’ de loss of my change. I hates to let
Skeeter an’ Shin bust me. Ef I kin jes’ show ’em
dat dey didn’t git it all, I’ll shore die happy.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Whiffle smiled. “Go ahead an’
die. You hunt up Skeeter Butts an’ Shin Bone an’
bet ’em dis money&mdash;make ’em gib you ten to one
on Skipper!”</p>

<p>When Pap departed, Whiffle made a circuit of
the stables, eyeing each negro loafer with intense
interest.</p>

<p>Finally she stopped and concentrated her attention
on one darky who sat on top of the fence
beside the track, a negro, the features of whose
face seemed to have disintegrated and merged in a
shapeless mass, as if the clay of which the face was
molded had “run” before it was dry.</p>

<p>The negro saw Whiffle without appearing to
look. Whiffle put up her hand and rubbed her
nose. Instantly the man ran two fingers into his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
ragged waistcoat pocket, brought them out, and
waved them under his nose with a loud sniff.</p>

<p>Whiffle promptly stepped to the fence beside
him, laid a fifty-cent piece upon the top rail, and
whispered one word. The man acted as if he did
not hear. Whiffle turned her back and looked
off across the green surrounded by the race-track,
and saw Skeeter Butts and Shin Bone leave the
pond in the middle of the green and walk toward
the betting-shed.</p>

<p>The negro climbed down from the fence and
disappeared in the crowd. Whiffle kept her eyes
on Skeeter and Shin until he had entirely disappeared.
Then she turned, and where the money
had been lying upon the fence there now rested a
folded paper. Whiffle palmed this paper and
walked slowly back to Skipper’s stall.</p>

<p>Entering the stall, she closed the door, opened
the paper and poked at the glistening crystals
with the tip of her forefinger.</p>

<p>Skipper drew near and sniffed at her hands,
begging for sweetmeats.</p>

<p>“Dis ain’t no sugar, Skipper,” she murmured,
catching him by the nose. “Whoa! You’ll make
me spill dis med’cine, an’ it costed me fifty cents!
Whoa!”</p>

<p>She licked a few remaining crystals off of her
trembling fingers, twisted the paper into a tiny
wad and walked out of the stall.</p>

<p>“Huh!” she sighed as she wiped the bitter taste
from her lips. “Ef Pap seed me lickin’ dat he’d
kill me!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<h3>VIII<br />

DISASTER.</h3>

<p>Skeeter Butts and Shin Bone stood in the
crowd at one of the entrances of the grandstand
and frowned and sneered at the importunate
negroes who crowded around them.</p>

<p>“Lend us jes’ a dollar or two, Skeeter,” they
pleaded. “Ef we could git a leetle start, mebbe
we could win some of our money back.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t loantin’ no money,” Skeeter proclaimed.
“I’s jes’ bettin’ money, an’ I done bet
all I’m got an’ couldn’t loant none ef I wanted
to.”</p>

<p>At that moment Pap Curtain joined the group,
waving five twenty-dollar bills. He had wasted
much time trying to locate Skeeter and Shin.</p>

<p>“Put up or shet up, Skeeter!” he howled gleefully.
“Here am one hunderd dollars whut say
dat Skipper wins dis race.”</p>

<p>“Bless gracious, Pap,” Skeeter grinned. “I
figgered dat I had you bust. Ef I’d ’a’ knowed
you had a single dollar lef’ I’d shore been to see
you. Now I done bet all I’m got.”</p>

<p>“Put up de Hen-Scratch saloon!” Pap taunted.
“I’ll bet you on anything you is got.”</p>

<p>“I got a race-hoss,” Skeeter grinned. “I’ll bet
Nigger Blackie agin fifty dollars dat Skipper don’t
win.”</p>

<p>“I takes it,” Pap said promptly.</p>

<p>“I’m got a Nigger Blackie race-hoss, too, Pap,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
Shin Bone suggested with a loud laugh. “You
seed me on him dis mawnin’.”</p>

<p>“I bets you ten dollars agin <i>yo’</i> race-hoss,” Pap
said promptly.</p>

<p>“I takes it,” Shin snickered.</p>

<p>Pap turned away with forty dollars, and found
no trouble in placing it on Skipper, with odds
against his horse of ten to one.</p>

<p>It was the last race of the day, and business was
brisk. The losers were squealing and begging
money, hoping for a chance to repair their fortunes.
The winners were whooping and resorting to every
means in their power to push their luck to the
limit and add to their loot.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, niggers!” one of the bloated, dressy
coons from the city whooped. “Git yo’ money
on de race! Dey’s saddlin’ up! Ef you wants to
git in on dis spec’lation now is de las’ an’ loudest
call fer yo’ money! Git busy!”</p>

<p>“Put yo’ las’ dollar on de las’ race an’ don’t cry
ef you bets it on de hoss dat comes in las’, niggers!”
another darky bawled as he waved a handful of
money. “You’ll be shore to git yo’ money’s wuth
of dis race, fer dese three hayburners cain’t lope
aroun’ dat track befo’ sundown!”</p>

<p>“Listen, Shin!” Skeeter said as he plucked at his
friend’s sleeve. “I ’speck we better hunt up
dat Whiffle Boone an’ make frien’s wid her over
agin. ’Tain’t no use to bear her no grudge&mdash;us
is winners!”</p>

<p>“Lawd, I done fergot dat sweet little gal offen my
mind!” Shin exclaimed as he hastened with Skeeter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
into the crowded grandstand and pushed through
the sweating multitude in his search for his girl.</p>

<p>“Dar she am!” Skeeter said, pointing. “You
go up an’ set on one side of her, an’ I’ll set on de
yuther side, an’ us’ll jolly her up!”</p>

<p>To their surprise, they found Whiffle as jolly
already as she could possibly be. She made room
for them, sat down between them and began to
talk like the whirr of a flutter-mill.</p>

<p>The bell rang for the fifth race, and the three
horses galloped up the track in front of the grandstand.
Skeeter noticed that Skipper’s jockey was
having the time of his life trying to keep his mount
on the track. The animal acted like he had an
insane desire to walk the fence, climb into the
grandstand, or slide on his ear.</p>

<p>“Somebody is done hit dat Skipper over de head
wid somepin an’ sot him crazy,” Skeeter commented.</p>

<p>“Don’t you slanderize Skipper now!” Whiffle
warned him. “Dat hoss b’longs to my maw.”</p>

<p>“He’s a good hoss all right,” Skeeter said propitiatingly.
“But of co’se he ain’t whut you mought
call a race-hoss.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>ain’t</i> he?” Whiffle sniffed. “He wus a
race-hoss when we bought him, an’ I bet I knows
mo’ about race-hossin’ dan you do!”</p>

<p>There was a loud whoop from the crowd and
Skeeter Butts raised himself on tiptoe and looked
with popping eyeballs.</p>

<p>“Bless <i>gracious</i>, whut a git-off!” Whiffle exclaimed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

<p>It was indeed a very bad start. In a few moments
the three horses were strung over a distance
of a hundred yards, but well to the front and all
alone a big gray named Skipper was skimming the
rail and running like a wild fox, while Skeeter’s
favorite bet, Peedee, was the last in the line.</p>

<p>“O Lawdy!” Skeeter sighed, his heart bumping
against the base of his tongue. “Dis is awful,
puffeckly awful!”</p>

<p>He sat down heavily and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Shin Bone took one look and vanished.</p>

<p>Whiffle Boone stood without a tremor of excitement
watching her horse.</p>

<p>“Run, you gray houn’ dawg, run!” she whooped
in a clear, bugle call.</p>

<p>At the head of the stretch Skipper was far ahead,
running like a high-powered automobile.</p>

<p>He passed under the wire and started around the
track again. In spite of the frantic efforts of his
jockey to stop him Skipper made the second mile
in record time.</p>

<p>As he passed the grandstand the negro who operated
the big bass drum brought down the drumstick
on the stretched pigskin with a loud “Boom!”</p>

<p>Skipper promptly jumped the fence, ran far over
in the field, bucked his jockey off, ran splashing
through the little artificial pond in the middle of
the green, and finally lay down in the water and
rolled over and over like a muskrat, kicking and
squealing and splashing the water and making
waves like Pharaoh’s army drowning in the sea!</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy!” Whiffle whined, watching the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
antics of the crazed horse and wringing her hands
in nervous distress. “I knowed Skipper was a
hop-hoss, but I didn’t ax nobody how much tea to
gib him. I figger dat I doped Skipper too high!”</p>

<p>The crowd was on its way home a long time
before they rescued Skipper from the pond and
persuaded the mud-begrimed winner to return to
his stall and be cleaned off.</p>

<p>At the head of the homeward-bound procession
walked Skeeter Butts and Shin Bone. Words
cannot describe their distress.</p>

<p>“Dis is a sad an’ sorrerful day fer me, Shin,”
Skeeter wept. “At de eend of de secont race I
owned all de money in de worl’. But now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush, Skeeter!” Shin said impatiently. “Yo’
mouf is jes’ like a gramophome&mdash;you sets it runnin’
an’ goes off an’ leaves it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Skeeter snarled. “I’ll shet up.
But fust I tells you dis, solemn an’ specific: I ain’t
never gwine bet on nothin’ no more! Dis here
expe’unce is done broke me from suckin’ eggs!”</p>

<p>“Hush, Skeeter!” Shin pleaded. “Lemme
medjertate!”</p>

<h3>IX<br />

ONE DOLLAR, ONE CENT, ONE WORM.</h3>

<p>Next morning, as Shin busied himself about the
stable of Colonel Tom Gaitskill, he was in the
depths of despair. The day before had been one of
wild betting, of wonderful winnings, and of most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
disastrous and heartbreaking losses. And this was
the last day of the fair, and Shin found himself
in a condition where there was no possibility of
recovering even a part of his lost fortune.</p>

<p>One by one he brought out Gaitskill’s handsome
horses and cleaned them until a man might rub
a silk handkerchief over their shiny coats and not
pick up a speck of dust.</p>

<p>Finally Shin brought out the beautiful sorrel
with the blazed face and the stiff, snake-bitten
leg. The animal was painfully lame, and Shin
spent an hour with various remedies striving to get
some of the rigidity out of the wounded leg.</p>

<p>Colonel Tom Gaitskill sauntered out from his
house to the stables, carrying his morning newspaper
in his hand.</p>

<p>“Mawnin,’ Kunnel!” Shin exclaimed. “Dis
old rattlesnake hoss is shore disencouragin’. It
’pears like his leg ain’t limberin’ up a-tall!”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” Gaitskill asked, slapping at the
gnats which flew annoyingly close to his face with
the newspaper and making a shrill, rattling sound.</p>

<p>Instantly the horse gave a loud snort, leaped
high into the air, broke the halter rope with which
he was tied to the post, sprang awkwardly across
the lot, and stood in the corner of the fence, looking
fearfully around him and blowing the air with
a whistling sound through his nostrils.</p>

<p>“What in the name of mud is the matter with
that fool?” Gaitskill demanded.</p>

<p>“Dat hoss is done expe’unce a rattlesnake,
Marse Tom, an’ dat rattlin’ newspaper skeart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
him” Shin Bone grinned. “When dat hoss hears
somepin rattle he don’t take no time to study&mdash;he
hikes!”</p>

<p>Shin walked over and led the trembling animal
back to the post. Gaitskill said with deep regret:</p>

<p>“My fine horse is ruined, Shin. If he should
recover from that stiff leg he would always be
unreliable.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a fack, Marse Tom,” Shin agreed.
“Nothin’ cain’t never make no rattlin’ sound
aroun’ him. I done expe’unce dat myse’f&mdash;he
throwed me off two times an’ nigh fractioned my
neck.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do with him now,”
Gaitskill said sadly.</p>

<p>“Sell him to me, Marse Tom!” Shin pleaded.
“Me an’ Whiffle Boone is gwine git married an’
start a eatin’-house, an’ ef I could own dis hoss
an’ a little wagon I could make plenty money wid
light haulin’.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill pondered this a moment. Then he
said:</p>

<p>“I’ll let you have him for forty dollars, Shin.”</p>

<p>“Suttinly, Marse Tom. I’ll take him!”</p>

<p>“But remember this: you must promise to turn
that horse into my pasture every night, so he can
get enough to eat. I won’t have you starve him.”</p>

<p>“A nigger don’t starve his own hoss, Kunnel,”
Shin Bone laughed. “A nigger will steal feed fer
his own hoss, but he won’t steal fer a white man’s
hoss.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill smiled and turned away. Shin gazed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
upon Rattlesnake with the proud eyes of an owner.
He put his arms around the animal’s slim, graceful
neck, drew the shapely head down upon his bosom,
and said:</p>

<p>“Cripple hoss, ef I jes’ had a live rattlesnake
to tie to yo’ tail, I figger I could go out on de race-track
dis day an’ win all de races whut is!”</p>

<p>Suddenly he straightened up, released the
horse’s head and turned away with an air of deep
dejection.</p>

<p>“Shucks!” he growled. “Marse Tom specify I
got to pay him fawty dollars fer dis hoss! Whar
kin I git dat money?”</p>

<p>Shin led the horse back to the stall and sat down
on a broken chair in the runway. Twenty minutes
of deep cogitation threw no light upon his
financial problem, so he rose with a sigh and idly
ran his hands through his empty pockets.</p>

<p>Suddenly he thought of the breast pocket of his
coat.</p>

<p>Hastily he thrust his hand into that pocket and
brought out one silver dollar and one copper cent.
Up to that moment he had forgotten this money
since he placed it there three days before.</p>

<p>“Dis two money fotch me luck one time,” he
sighed. “Mebbe I could git a little lift from ’em
agin ef Skeeter Butts hadn’t took cold foots an’
announce his specify dat he warn’t gwine race
no mo’.”</p>

<p>He walked out of the stable, stopped beside a big
pine stump in the stable yard, laid his dollar on
top of the stump and placed the copper penny on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
top of the dollar in as nearly the exact center as he
could calculate.</p>

<p>Then he lifted up some planks which lay deeply
buried in the dirt in the corner of the yard and
captured two red earthworms. He took one of
these worms and laid it in the exact center of the
copper coin.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Worm,” Shin commanded, “you
crawl often dat cent and specify to me whut direction
to go to git some money! Gimme a sign!”</p>

<p>The worm started to crawl off. In his progress
his head touched the silver dollar. The worm
stopped and promptly crawled back upon the
copper. He started again in another direction,
but the moment its body touched the silver dollar
the worm drew back.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Shin grunted. “Dis worm is igernunt&mdash;he
don’t know which way to go!”</p>

<p>Shin watched him with intense curiosity. He
picked up a straw and gave him little pushes to
assist his progress, then he suddenly took a breath
which threatened to suck in all the air in the stable-yard.</p>

<p>“Bless Gawd!” he exclaimed with heartfelt
gratitude. “It’s a shore, certain fack!”</p>

<p>He tossed the worm aside, pocketed the money
and made a beeline to the Hen-Scratch saloon.</p>

<p>That popular resort was crowded with the
colored inhabitants of Tickfall. They raved and
bellowed and drank and laughed and rattled the
money in their pockets and discussed the races of
the day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>Shin entered quietly, and after a few minutes he
picked up a table and set it in the middle of the
room, placing a chair beside it. Seating himself
with great ceremony, he put his silver dollar in the
center of the table and placed his copper cent on top
of the dollar.</p>

<p>The noise of talking and laughing ceased and the
negroes crowded around Shin Bone.</p>

<p>Like all negroes, Shin had a dramatic gift, and
he played it to the limit. His actions were
attended by no explanations and had an air of
deep mystery. Then he spoke:</p>

<p>“Whut nigger in dis house is got a fishin’
worm?”</p>

<p>There was a long, astonished silence. Finally
Pap Curtain spoke:</p>

<p>“Whut you want wid a fishin’ worm, Shinny?
Want to eat yo’ breakfust?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh,” Shin proclaimed. “I’s gwine
make a bet.”</p>

<p>“Whut does you bet?” Hitch Diamond bellowed.</p>

<p>Shin Bone rose to his feet. Pointing dramatically
at the money, he shouted:</p>

<p>“I bets any money dat I kin put a fishin’ worm
on top of dat copper cent, an’ dat worm will starve
an’ squinch up an’ die, befo’ he will crawl across
dat silver dollar an’ git away!”</p>

<p>This announcement was followed by intense silence.
Finally Pap Curtain remarked:</p>

<p>“Dat’s some kind of trick dollar.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so!” Shin howled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<p>“How much will you bet?” Hitch Diamond
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Any money!”</p>

<p>“Will you lemme furnish my own dollar?” Pap
Curtain inquired.</p>

<p>“Suttinly!”</p>

<p>“Will you lemme furnish de copper cent?”
Hitch Diamond bellowed.</p>

<p>“Shorely!”</p>

<p>“Will you lemme furnish de fishin’ worm?”
Prince Total squealed.</p>

<p>“Yep!”</p>

<p>“Lawd, niggers!” Hitch Diamond roared.
“Shin Bone is done gone cripple under de hat!
Less bust him!”</p>

<p>Shin Bone pocketed his dollar and his copper
and sat down at the table. There was a wild
flurry as Prince Total pushed through the crowd
to go out and dig an earth-worm. Hitch Diamond
sat down in the middle of the sand-covered barroom
floor, laid a copper cent down, placed an
immense middle finger upon it and began to scour
it up and down until the penny shone like new.
Pap Curtain dropped a silver dollar upon the floor,
placed his boot upon it and scraped it up and down
in the sand. When he placed it upon the table it
looked like a new-minted dollar.</p>

<p>A moment later Prince Total appeared with a fat
red earth-worm.</p>

<p>“Put yo’ money on de table, niggers,” Shin
Bone announced as he rose to his feet. “I takes
eve’y bet up to fo’ hunderd dollars. I bought a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
eatin’-house from Marse Tom Gaitskill fer fo’
hunderd dollars, an’ dat house covers all my bets!”</p>

<p>“I keeps de books!” Skeeter Butts squealed,
flourishing a pencil and a sheet of paper. “Bellow
yo’ bets in a loud voice!”</p>

<p>“Pap Curtain, twenty dollars!” Pap proclaimed.</p>

<p>“Hitch Diamond, twenty!”</p>

<p>“Prince Total, twenty!”</p>

<p>“Figger Bush, twenty!”</p>

<p>All of this was perfectly familiar to the negroes
for this reason: in the negro churches when a
collection is taken up a table is placed, a secretary
is appointed, and each donor marches to the front
of the congregation, places his gift upon the table,
announces the amount in a loud voice and retires.</p>

<p>In ten minutes the table contained a goodly
amount of currency and silver, and Shin Bone
swept the contribution from the top of the table
into his hat.</p>

<p>“Two hundred an’ fo’ dollars is bet, niggers!”
Shin announced. “Now, Prince Total, advance
an’ produce de worm!”</p>

<p>Pap Curtain laid his shiny silver dollar in the
center of the table. Hitch Diamond placed his
shiny copper cent in the center of the dollar.
Prince Total placed his fat, shiny, squirmy earth-worm
in the center of the cent.</p>

<p>Shin Bone walked over close to the exit, climbed
upon the end of the bar so he could see by looking
over the heads of the negroes, and began to pocket
the money contained in his hat.</p>

<p>There was the most intense and overwhelming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
silence as the crowd watched the worm. It started
off the cent, but it never stayed off. The penny
was small and the worm was large, and sometimes
it overflowed and touched the silver. When that
happened the worm displayed the most intense
discomfort, and the most eager desire to readjust
its folds and scramble back upon the copper.</p>

<p>A loud groan arose from the watching negroes.</p>

<p>Shin Bone stood up on the end of the bar and
squealed:</p>

<p>“Good-bye, niggers! Ef dat worm ever gits
offen dat copper cent I’ll pay de money back an’
eat de worm raw!”</p>

<p>He turned and walked out of the saloon a happy
and wealthy man!</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Pap Curtain, Hitch Diamond,
and Prince Total appeared at the home of Colonel
Tom Gaitskill.</p>

<p>“Kunnel,” Hitch said earnestly, “us niggers
wants to show you somepin an’ ax you how
come!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” Gaitskill smiled.</p>

<p>Pap laid a silver dollar on the floor of the porch,
Hitch Diamond placed a copper cent on top of it,
and Prince Total laid a worm on top of the cent.</p>

<p>“Now, Kunnel, fer Gawd’s sake, tell us how
come dat worm cain’t crawl offen dat cent?”</p>

<p>Gaitskill laughed.</p>

<p>“That is a simple demonstration in experimental
electricity, men,” he said. “When the worm’s
damp body which is in contact with the copper
touches the silver it starts a current of electricity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
that gives it a shock. Of course the current thus
produced is very slight, but it is quite enough for
the worm, and the worm finds it more comfortable
to stay on the copper coin.”</p>

<p>“Dat shore is a strange an’ expensive fack, Marse
Tom,” Hitch Diamond remarked gloomily.</p>

<p>“De nigger whut bets his dollars on dat exper’ment
ain’t gwine git no slight shock,” Pap Curtain
declared.</p>

<p>“An’ he ain’t gwine hab even a copper cent to
stan’ on!” Prince Total concluded.</p>

<h3>X<br />

RATTLESNAKE.</h3>

<p>All of Shin Bone’s victims were sitting in the
grandstand when Shin rode on the track that
afternoon to exhibit his newly purchased horse.</p>

<p>“Hello, Shinny!” Hitch Diamond yelled.
“Whar you git dat plug?”</p>

<p>“Marse Tom sold him to me fer fawty dollars,”
Shin grinned. “You all he’ped me to pay fer
him when you bit like suckers at dat fishin’ worm!”</p>

<p>“Is you gwine race him?” Pap whooped.</p>

<p>“Suttinly. He goes in de las’ race.”</p>

<p>“Is you gwine bet on him?” Prince Total
squealed.</p>

<p>“I bets eve’y cent I’m got,” Shin grinned.
“Dis hoss’s name is Rattlesnake, an’ he’s pure
p’ison.”</p>

<p>Shin trotted his horse down the track, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
negroes watched the stiff hind leg of the animal
and noticed that the horse never raised it far
enough above the ground to prevent it making a
long mark upon the turf. Shin galloped back in
front of his friends, and the crippled horse awkwardly
dragged his stiff leg, making a longer and
deeper mark upon the track.</p>

<p>“I wonder ef dat nigger really means whut he
say?” Pap remarked as he sat back in his seat.</p>

<p>“Whut race is you in, Pap?” Hitch Diamond
asked.</p>

<p>“I starts Nigger Blackie in de las’ race,” Pap
told him. “I bet Doodlebug yistiddy an’ lost
him, but I speck he’s gwine in dat race, too. Of
co’se Nigger Blackie kin beat Doodlebug&mdash;he done
it yistiddy.”</p>

<p>“I thought Nigger Blackie b’longed to Skeeter
Butts,” Hitch said.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh. I winned Nigger offen Skeeter
yistiddy.”</p>

<p>“How many hosses in dat las’ race?” Prince
Total asked.</p>

<p>“Gawd knows,” Pap sighed. “It’s de las’
race of de fair. It’s a free-fer-all scramble, an’
eve’y nigger in dis parish kin git in wid a race-hoss
ef he wants to.”</p>

<p>“I tells you whut, niggers,” Hitch Diamond
suggested. “Shin Bone is done robbed us of a
heap of money; now less go down an’ bet agin him
an’ his hoss an’ rob him of all de chink he’s got.
Dat stiff-leg Rattlesnake cain’t run&mdash;any hoss kin
beat him as fur as you kin shoot a gun.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>“I favors dat!” Pap exclaimed. “Dis is de las’
race of de las’ day of de fair. I favors makin’ it de
las’ of Shin Bone. I’s done got plum’ nauseated
wid dat nigger anyhow.”</p>

<p>They waited on Shin in a body and proposed to
take all his money away from him.</p>

<p>“I bets dollar fer dollar, niggers,” Shin replied
smilingly. “I is got one hunderd an’ sixty dollars,
an’ I lets it go easy.”</p>

<p>“Who holds de stakes?” Pap Curtain asked.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” Shin answered. “I ain’t figgered
on dat.”</p>

<p>“How will Whiffle Boone suit?” Pap inquired:</p>

<p>“She suits,” Shin said indifferently. “Less
hunt her up.”</p>

<p>They found Whiffle in the grandstand and
explained what they wanted her to do. She
gladly consented and accepted their money,
keeping a record of the amount of their bets.</p>

<p>When the men left her Whiffle sat for a long time
in deep meditation, then she started on a search
for Shin Bone.</p>

<p>Shin was busy at the stable plaiting Rattlesnake’s
mane and tail into long, hard braids, a half
dozen on the mane and as many on the tail. He
was working eagerly, confidently, with the manner
of a man who knew what he was doing.</p>

<p>“Shinny,” Whiffle asked, “who is gwine ride
yo’ hoss?”</p>

<p>“I’m is.”</p>

<p>“Is you shore you is gwine win, Shin?”</p>

<p>“Suttinly.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p>“I don’t see how dat cripple hoss kin run,”
Whiffle remarked in troubled tones.</p>

<p>“It do ’pear like dat stiff leg hinders him some,”
Shin grinned. “But I done found out somepin
’bout dis hoss: he ain’t skeart of nothin’ but a
rattlesnake.”</p>

<p>“Dat discover don’t make him run no faster,”
Whiffle replied.</p>

<p>“No’m. But ef I was to tie a rattlesnake to his
tail I ’speck he would run some.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Whiffle snorted disgustedly. “You
ain’t gwine tie no snake to dat hoss’s tail.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a fack,” Shin snickered. “I’s skeart of
snakes. But I tells you dis honest, Whiffle: ef
you got any money to bet, you bet it on Rattlesnake.
I wouldn’t tell you dis ef I didn’t love you
more’n anybody!”</p>

<p>“I owns one hunderd dollars, Shin. Me an’
Pap winned in de race whut busted you up yistiddy.
I’s gwine bet on Rattlesnake fer yo’ sake, because
I loves you.”</p>

<p>It seemed a long time to Shin Bone before the
last race. A good hour before that contest of
speed Shin had Rattlesnake saddled and waiting.</p>

<p>When at last the bell rang for the final racing
event of the fair Shin mounted his stiff-legged
steed and rode slowly out upon the track. He
counted and found that fifteen other horses were
entered, the only formidable rivals to Rattlesnake
being Doodlebug and Nigger Blackie.</p>

<p>There are various methods in use among horsemen
to extract speed from their race-horses.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>

<p>Sometimes a jockey carries an electric battery
in one of his riding boots, and the battery is connected
with copper wire to his spurs; sometimes
the battery is hidden in the saddle and the saddle
is stitched and lined with copper wire; sometimes
the battery is concealed in the butt end of the
riding whip. These methods often lead to the
detection of dishonesty. A better way is to carry
a hand buzzer and apply the juice until the race
is won; then the jockey can toss the hand buzzer
over the fence and defy the inspection of the
judges. Sometimes a groom or rubber pours a
bottle of liquid called “High Life” over the horse’s
back, or administers a dose of dope; in that case
the jockey has the struggle of his life to prevent his
horse from climbing into the judges’ stand before
he can get a start.</p>

<p>But Shin Bone pulled the most unique stunt
ever attempted on a race-track.</p>

<p>The best speed extractor in the world for white
flesh, colored flesh, or horse flesh is Fright. Fear
will make a lame man walk, a crippled horse run,
and a paralyzed negro sprout wings and fly.</p>

<p>Shin rode Rattlesnake without spurs, or whip,
or dope, or high life, or electricity. All in the
world that he had to induce his horse to run was a
handful of toy baby rattles which he had swiped
from the nursery of Colonel Tom Gaitskill’s grandchild.
Woven in Rattlesnake’s plaited mane were
half a dozen celluloid balls, containing two or three
buckshot each and marks outside of a baby’s tiny
teeth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p>As Rattlesnake stumped about on his stiff leg
they made no disturbing sound; but Shin had
learned by experiment that a little burst of speed
started the rattling, and the big horse did the
rest!</p>

<p>The fifteen horses trotted down toward the
starter’s stand in a pretty fair alignment. Vinegar
Atts, the starter, was tired of his week’s work
and easy to please.</p>

<p>“Go!” he whooped.</p>

<p>Rattlesnake broke into an awkward gallop.
Then Shin Bone reached back and pulled a string
in the rear of his saddle.</p>

<p>Four noisy celluloid baby rattles, each suspended
from a strong string, dropped down around
the legs of Rattlesnake.</p>

<p>The horse heard that deadly, venomous rattle,
and felt something touch his flanks and drop further
and tap him on the legs; right behind his ears
he heard a dreadful whirring sound, as if a snake
were entwined in his mane!</p>

<p>He uttered a scream so shrill, so horrible, that
every negro in the grandstand shuddered.</p>

<p>Then he leaped forward, and the pop-eyed
negroes had never seen such running in their lives!</p>

<p>Rattlesnake’s body lay out in a level line, nose,
shoulder, back, and his flying legs were a yellow
blur beneath his straining body. But not all the
thunder of his going could deaden the sound of
that fearful rattle, which whirred like the wind in
his ears, stirring the remembrance of suffering and
sickness and the agony of the cauterizing iron!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span></p>

<p>Faster, faster, faster Rattlesnake ran, his feet
spurning the brown carpet of turf beneath him, his
crippled hind leg limbering up for the last time in
his life and shooting his body forward like the
piston rod of an engine.</p>

<p>The race was won in an incredible time.</p>

<p>As the terrified horse shot under the wire Shin
reached behind his saddle and tore loose the cords
which held the rattles flapping around the animal’s
flanks; then he ran his hands through the plaited
mane and pulled off the rattles which whirred
behind Rattlesnake’s ears, and the horse slowly
slackened his speed and stopped, his sides heaving,
his breath coming and going like a giant bellows.</p>

<p>When the other horses came in Shin rode slowly
back and held up his hand.</p>

<p>“Judges?” he called.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts nodded his head and waved his
hand toward the stable.</p>

<p>When Shin Bone dismounted at the stall Whiffle
Boone ran forward with the tears running down
her laughing face.</p>

<p>She jerked Shin’s hat from his head, turned it
upside down on the ground and filled it with
money. Then she threw her arms around the
graceful, throbbing, sweating neck of the big sorrel
horse.</p>

<p>“We win!” she sobbed. “Bless Gawd! We
win!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All this happened three years ago, and there has
never been another race at any Tickfall Negro Fair.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p>For three years Shin Bone’s wife has been in
charge of the restaurant which she bought with
her winnings in the last great race. For three
years Shin Bone has met every train with a light
wagon drawn by a pie-faced, stiff-legged sorrel
horse. His owner “wrastles trunks an’ gripsacks
fer de white folks.” His horse is as fat as butter,
but he runs away every time he hears a rattling
sound.</p>

<p>Last fall Shin and Whiffle drove Rattlesnake
out to the fairground and entered a two-year-old
negro boy in the Better Babies’ contest. Colonel
Tom Gaitskill had offered handsome prizes in this
contest and was in charge.</p>

<p>“This is your son, Shin?” Gaitskill smiled as
he entered the piccaninny’s name and age in a
large book.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh.”</p>

<p>“I presume it is a eugenic, hygienic baby?”
Gaitskill laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Shin replied, wondering at the
same time what Gaitskill meant. “Yes, suh. He
gits de you-jeans from his maw an’ de high-jeans
from his paw. He’s a shore winner!”

<h3>I<br />

THE STRANGER.</h3>

<p>Dinner Gaze bore the air of a man who was
perfectly satisfied with his personal appearance
and sure of making a good impression upon all who
beheld him.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his seat in the negro coach of
the New Orleans accommodation, using the seat
in front of him as a footstool. His legs were
crossed with a display of glorious silk hosiery, his
thumbs were anchored in the armholes of his gold
and purple vest, his bright green cravat contained
a bright yellow diamond, and his cigarette-stained
fingers beat a happy tattoo upon the bosom of his
shirt.</p>

<p>The face of Dinner Gaze was black, and as
expressionless as the ugly mug of a dough man.
There was a long mark upon his cheek where a
bullet had missed the center of his face about two
inches. There was a long knife-scar on the back
and side of his neck. A bit of the upper part of
his left ear was missing, sliced off smoothly with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
a sharp knife or razor. The end of one of his
front teeth was broken off. His eyes were as
steady and unwinking and shiny as two glass
beads, his voice was low and soft and confidential
in tone, and his heavy lips carried an habitual
sneer.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond, who sat beside him, was similarly
satisfied.</p>

<p>Hitch’s appearance cried aloud his profession of
pugilist. His face was a scarred ruin, battered
and bruised in many a fistic battle until it resembled
the face of the Sphinx since it has been pecked
at and damaged by the souvenir hunters and sandstorms
of the centuries. His ponderous hands
looked like the gnarled and twisted roots of a scrub-oak
tree, while his legs were like the Corinthian
columns supporting the portico of a temple.</p>

<p>Hitch had made a trip to New Orleans for pugilistic
purposes. At the end of the second round,
Hitch had looked down at his opponent, then
waved his gloved fist at the whooping crowd and
remarked: “I know whut I done to dat coon!
He’s gwine sleep a long time!” After which
Hitch had collected a hatful of money and remained
in New Orleans long enough to get it all
nicely spent except a puny wad in one pocket of his
shiny new pantaloons.</p>

<p>Every rag of clothes on Hitch’s giant body was
entirely new. He was swathed in a Prince Albert
coat, choked and tortured by a high collar and a
stiff-bosomed shirt; a glorious silk hat, all white
silk lining on the inside, and smooth, shiny,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
imitation beaver on the outside, rode on his head;
while on his feet were a pair of patent-leather
shoes which had caused him a world of trouble in
the city.</p>

<p>He had walked for miles, in and out of the
stores, seeking a pair of shiny shoes which would
fit his immense feet. Shoe clerks had taken one
look at those pedal extremities and had thrown
up their hands in despair. But Hitch had persisted
in his search, and now it was plainly apparent
to all that Solomon in all his glory was not
shod like such as he.</p>

<p>Dinner Gaze was listening with great interest
to Hitch’s talk.</p>

<p>“I ain’t went to N’Awleens befo’ fer mighty
nigh five year,” said Hitch as he extracted a long
Perique stogie from the side-pocket of his gorgeous
yellow waistcoat.</p>

<p>Dinner Gaze reached out, took the stogie from
Hitch’s giant hand, and tossed it out of the window.
He handed the pugilist a big, fat cigar with
a broad gold band, and grinned in a friendly way.
Then he said in his low, gentle voice:</p>

<p>“Ef you wants me to set by you, don’t smoke no
roll of rags an’ garbage. Take a real seegar!”</p>

<p>“Thank ’e, suh,” Hitch murmured gratefully,
removing the gold band and fitting it carefully
upon his little finger where he admired it as a
maiden admires her engagement ring. “I’s powerful
sorry dar ain’t no lady folks in dis car to see
me smoke dis. I ain’t never feel like I had
enough money to ack liberal an’ buy real smokes.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

<p>“Ain’t you spek dat you got a wad to tote home
from de city wid you?” Gaze inquired carelessly,
as he tore a page from a newspaper and began idly
to roll it tightly.</p>

<p>“Shore!” Hitch chuckled. “I totes it in my
behime hip-pocket next to my heart, whar unpious
niggers totes dey gun. But most of dat is jes’ show
money&mdash;’tain’t much, an’ I got it wropped up in a
roll to make it look like a plenty. Fawty dollars
is all whut is lef’ of my trip to de city&mdash;excusin’ de
mem’ry of a dam’ good time, an’ dese clothes!”</p>

<p>“Whar you gwine now?” Dinner asked as he
fumbled with his paper.</p>

<p>“I’s gittin’ off at Sawtown,” Hitch replied. “I
been livin’ aroun’ in dis part of de worl’ all my
life, an’ I ain’t never seed dat big saw-mill town yit.
’Tain’t been but ’bout fo’ year ago dat Sawtown
started off&mdash;when dey sot dat big mill dar in de
woods.”</p>

<p>“I’s proud I met up wid you, Revun,” Dinner
Gaze said. “I lives in Sawtown, an’ I’ll show you
all de good p’ints in de place.”</p>

<p>Hitch opened his mouth to deny that he was a
preacher, but the negro’s natural love of the game
of make-believe prevented him. His slow mind
evolved the humor of the situation, and he bestowed
a pious smile upon the man beside him.</p>

<p>“Thank ’e, suh. I ain’t gwine let nothin’ git
past me. I’s gwine to all de shows, an’ drink all de
ice-water I kin git, an’ chaw peanuts, an’ git right
in de middle of de cullud high life.”</p>

<p>“Dat picayune way of seein’ Sawtown won’t git
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
you nothin’,” Dinner Gaze grunted disgustedly.
“Bust her wide open, Revun!”</p>

<p>“How is dat did?” Hitch wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you!” Gaze told him.</p>

<p>“Whut job does you wuck at in Sawtown?”
Hitch asked.</p>

<p>“I’m gittin’ ready to sot up a little nigger gamblin’-house
in Sawtown now,” Dinner replied
cautiously, after a moment’s hesitation. “Befo’
dat, I managed a string of nigger prize-fighters in
N’Awleens.”</p>

<p>Hitch raised his battered head like an old,
scarred war-horse when he hears the bugle-call for
charge. Then he remembered that Gaze thought
he was talking to a clergyman.</p>

<p>“Dat shore sounds familious to me,” Hitch
laughed. “I used to be a prize-fighter my own
se’f!”</p>

<p>“Hear dat, now!” Dinner Gaze exclaimed. “I
knowed you an’ me wus kinnery when I fust cotch
you wid my eye. How come you left de great
perfesh?”</p>

<p>“A nigger put a chunk of lead in his glove an’
battered me clean acrost a wharf-boat,” Hitch
narrated, drawing upon his imagination, and
recalling an incident in the career of his friend,
the Reverend Vinegar Atts. “Atter dat I felt a
call to preach.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe you could come back,” Gaze suggested.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh,” Hitch grinned, quoting a remark
he had heard Vinegar make. “Preachin’ is a
plum’ sight safer. I kin git up befo’ a lot of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
Christyums an’ knock noses an’ pull hair an’ skin
shins all I’m got a mind to, an’ all dey kin do is to
turn aroun’ de yuther cheek. Ef dey hits back,
dey ain’t pious!”</p>

<p>The odor of wet, sawed, sun-scorched lumber
entered the car window. The suction of the
moving train threw sawdust upon the seat where
the feet of the two men rested. They were drawing
near to the station at Sawtown.</p>

<p>“Revun,” Dinner asked, as he rose, “is you ever
read up on dat Bible text whut says ‘I wus a
stranger an’ I got took in’?”</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Hitch prevaricated.</p>

<p>“My last advices to you is to keep a eye on de
people in dis here Sawtown. Dey takes a stranger
in good an’ plenty!”</p>

<p>Dinner dusted off his patent-leather shoes,
adjusted his immaculate cuffs, felt of his green tie
and his yellow diamond, lifted his Panama hat out
of the rack, and brushed the cigar ashes off his
gold and purple vest.</p>

<p>“Drap in de Hot-dog Club an’ gimme a look-on,
Revun!” Gaze invited as he stepped into the aisle.
“I handles a pretty peart gamblin’ game ef I do
say it myse’f!”</p>

<p>The train stopped.</p>

<p>Dinner Gaze waited in the aisle, courteously
permitting Hitch Diamond to precede him.</p>

<p>As Hitch passed out, Dinner Gaze cautiously
elevated the tail of the pugilist’s Prince Albert
coat, carefully thrust two scissors-like fingers into
Hitch’s hip-pocket and drew out a small roll of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
money. In its place he thrust a wad of newspaper
of about the same size. When the train had gone
on, Hitch looked for his friend and could not
find him.</p>

<p>“Dar now!” he exclaimed. “Dat wus a fine
nigger man an’ I done loss him complete, an’ I
even fergot to ax him whut wus his name!”</p>

<h3>II<br />

“TOOK IN.”</h3>

<p>“De fust thing I needs is a sack of peanuts an’ a
awange to cut de dust outen my throat,” Hitch
said to himself, as he walked slowly down the
village street.</p>

<p>He entered a small grocery, made his purchases,
and thrust his fingers into his hip-pocket to bring
forth his money.</p>

<p>Instead he extracted a wad of newspapers.</p>

<p>Hitch stupidly unfolded the paper, gazed at it
with hypnotic fascination, searched all his pockets
for his lost money, then searched them again,
hunting for loose change.</p>

<p>The disgusted clerk tossed the bag of peanuts
back into the roaster, laid the orange back on the
shelf, walked over to a chair and sat down, his
mind spluttering like wet fireworks with his unspoken
comments on the colored race in general
and Hitch in particular.</p>

<p>Hitch stumbled stupidly out of the store, broke
and broken-hearted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>He looked around him uncertainly, then dragged
his ponderous feet back toward the depot, hoping
to find his lost money. After half an hour’s
search he gave it up and started aimlessly toward
the river.</p>

<p>Half-way down the block he met a tall negro
whose face was slightly disfigured by a broken
nose. The man wore a checkerboard suit of
clothes, a cowboy hat, and a sport shirt. Hitch’s
eyes fell first upon the emblem of a negro lodge
which the man wore on the lapel of his coat.</p>

<p>Hitch eagerly laid hold upon his lodge brother,
“I’s in powerful bad trouble, brudder,” he moaned.
“I ain’t know nobody in dis town an’ I done loss all
my money on my way to dis place. Whut kin be
did?”</p>

<p>“De next best thing is to go down to de big mill
an’ set on de buzz-saw,” the brother advised.</p>

<p>“Whut good will dat do me?” Hitch inquired.</p>

<p>“It’ll fix you so trouble won’t trouble you no
more,” Checkerboard grinned, patting Hitch on
his powerful back. “Atter you takes yo’ seat
you won’t need no money&mdash;de Nights of Darkness
lodge will bury yo’ remainders free fer nothin’
an’ sot you up a real nice tombstone.”</p>

<p>“I got plenty white folks in my own home
town,” Hitch continued, paying no attention to
his companion’s foolishness. “I mought could git
some he’p mebbe ef I had somewhar to wait at
ontil dey sont me de money.”</p>

<p>The checkerboard negro looked Hitch over;
then his eyes narrowed and he smiled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<p>“As a lodge brudder in good standin’, I could
lead you to my own house an’ keep you a little
while,” Checkerboard remarked. “Whar is yo’
lodge pin?”</p>

<p>Hitch glanced down at the lapel of his coat.</p>

<p>“My gosh!” he mourned. “I done loss my
money an’ my lodge breastpin too. Dat breastpin
wus jes’ perzackly like de one you is got on an’
wus gib me by Skeeter Butts.”</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Checkerboard laughed. “Dey is
all made alike an’ look jes’ de same. Mebbe de
feller whut touched yo’ wad frisked yo’ pin, too.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s whut happened,” Hitch sighed. “But
it don’t he’p me none to know dat news.”</p>

<p>“You’se too blame young to be trabbelin’ alone,”
Checkerboard snickered. “You needs a fust-rate
gardeen. Foller atter me!”</p>

<p>He conducted Hitch to the rear of the big sawmill,
led him through a maze of immense lumber
piles, and brought him around the big mill-pond
to a cluster of houses built by the owners of the
mill for the occupancy of their negro employees.</p>

<p>There was one two-story house which looked like
a barracks, and was intended for use by men who
had no families. Into this Checkerboard led his
companion.</p>

<p>“Set down, Revun,” he smiled. “Dis here is
my boardin’-house. I keeps it fer de ’commodation
of de nigger workers in de mill whut ain’t
got no wifes an’ no home. Dey eats in dat
eatin’-house down dar by de mill-pond an’ sleeps
here.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

<p>“It’s powerful hot in dis place,” Hitch complained
as he seated himself.</p>

<p>“We keeps de winders down in de daytime
because eve’ybody whut stays here is busy in de
mill,” Checkerboard explained, as he pulled off his
coat and hung it across his arm. “Pull off dat
coat of yourn, an’ I’ll take yo’ stove-pipe hat an’
coat an’ hang ’em up wid mine.”</p>

<p>Hitch gratefully removed his hat and coat and
sat down. He took a stogie from his vest-pocket
and felt for a match.</p>

<p>“Don’t you wanter take off dat vest, too?”
Checkerboard inquired. “You might git seegar
ash all over it.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Hitch said, as he handed his
friend the vest.</p>

<p>“Make yo’se’f at home, Revun,” Checkerboard
said graciously. “Smoke all you please to&mdash;spit
on de flo’&mdash;ack like you wus at yo’ own house! I
got to hump aroun’ a leetle on bizzness befo’ de
mill blows de whistle fer closin’ time. But I tells
you in eggsvance, dat as fur’s I’m concerned, you
kin stay in dis house fer a mont’.”</p>

<p>“You is a true lodge brudder,” Hitch rumbled
in real gratitude. “I won’t never fergit you!”</p>

<p>Checkerboard left the room, walked through
the hallway, passed out of the rear door, clambered
down into a gulley, and carried Hitch’s
clothes through a labyrinth of lumber piles to a
place far, far away!</p>

<p>Hitch waited for nearly an hour for Checkerboard
to return. Feeling the lack of companionship,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
he walked down to the mill-pond and accosted
the slouchy negro woman in the kitchen of the
eating-house.</p>

<p>To his surprise he learned that she had never
seen nor heard of the man in the checkerboard
suit.</p>

<p>“It ’pears to me like dese here folks ain’t plum’
honest,” Hitch mourned as he walked disconsolately
around the mill-pond trying to find his
way back to the village.</p>

<p>He spent a long time looking for the man who
had his clothes, mumbling complainingly to himself
the while. At last he wandered to the wharf
on the Mississippi River and sat down with his
back resting against a post.</p>

<p>His feet were unaccustomed to the wear of
patent-leather shoes, and they felt swollen and
tired. He took off his shoes, set them side by side
in front of him, waved his feet in the cool river
breeze, and gazed upon his footwear lovingly.</p>

<p>“I kin git me anodder hat an’ coat,” he muttered.
“But dem shoes would be a powerful
loss. Dar ain’t no more shoes in N’Awleens dat’ll
fit my foots!”</p>

<p>Half a block away two little white boys were
cutting monkey-shines on the sidewalk. In the
dusty gutter one boy picked up a long, black
stocking.</p>

<p>The two considered this find for a moment, then
they gathered small sticks and thrust them into
the stocking. One youth produced a ball of kite
twine and tied an end of the twine around the open
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
end of the stocking. After that, they dropped
the stocking upon the pavement and pulled it along
by the string, observing the effect.</p>

<p>“It wiggles all right,” they chuckled.</p>

<p>They looked around for a victim and spotted
Hitch Diamond.</p>

<p>One of the boys held the stocking and concealed
himself behind a pile of lumber on the wharf. The
other boy, playing out the ball of twine, walked
along the wharf, his bare feet making no sound.
He passed close behind Hitch Diamond and stopped
and concealed himself on the other side of some
shipping about one hundred feet beyond the point
where Hitch Diamond sat.</p>

<p>Then the boy with the ball began to wind the
twine in. The long black stocking crawled up
closer and closer to the inert form of Hitch Diamond.</p>

<p>Finally, when the stocking had wriggled grotesquely
to within ten feet of Hitch Diamond,
there was a loud whoop&mdash;a white boy ran from
behind some lumber and shrieked:</p>

<p>“Look at that sna-a-a-ke, nigger! Jump!”</p>

<p>Hitch jumped.</p>

<p>He sprinted down the wharf a hundred yards,
pattering along in his sock feet, leaving his precious
shoes behind him.</p>

<p>The little white boy shrieked with laughter,
picked up the wriggling stocking, and jumped
next for Hitch’s shoes.</p>

<p>For a moment he paused, filled with awe when
he beheld their monstrous and incredible size;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
then, doubtless reflecting upon their resemblance
to a big mudscow, he put each shoe where a mudscow
properly belongs&mdash;in the river!</p>

<p>“Hey, you nigger!” a wharf watchman called
sharply, as Hitch, looking behind him, ran full tilt
into the watchman’s portly form.</p>

<p>“’Scuse me, boss!” Hitch grunted.</p>

<p>The watchman hung three strong fingers in the
collar of Hitch’s white shirt. Hitch didn’t like
that. He pulled away. The watchman pulled
too. The inevitable happened.</p>

<p>Hitch’s shirt tore half in two and hung limply in
the watchman’s hands as Hitch raced down the
wharf clad in socks, pants, and a red undershirt!</p>

<p>The watchman disgustedly tossed his spoils on
top of a lumber pile and gave himself up to the
placid contemplation of the flight of some gulls on
the river.</p>

<p>“Lawd,” Hitch sighed, when he had dodged
around the distant end of the wharf and had time
to look down at his deficient apparel. “Dis
here town shore is hard on clothes!”</p>

<h3>III<br />

FOURTEEN SWALLOWS.</h3>

<p>Keeping the river levee between himself and
the town so that no one could see him in his
half-dressed condition, Hitch departed from the
vicinity of Sawtown with expedition. When he
reached the edge of the woods about a mile from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
the mill, he sat down to think a way out of his
difficulties.</p>

<p>“My head is jes’ like a mule’s head,” he announced
to himself. “I cain’t hold but only one
notion at a time. I been thinkin’ so heavy all
de time about my lost money dat I done loss all
my good clothes, too. I oughter knowed better.
Now I’s gwine git active an’ sot myse’f up in
bizzness agin.”</p>

<p>He sat for a long time in deep, silent meditation,
trying to extract an idea from his slow
brain. Then he concluded:</p>

<p>“I drunk too much dram in N’Awleens. My
head ain’t right. Ef I could git me a good dram
now, mebbe I could think up a notion whut to
do.”</p>

<p>In his impoverished condition he saw no way
of buying a drink. He cast about to see what he
possessed which he might exchange for one, and
pulled out of his hip-pocket his silk socks, the joy
and pride of his life in their glorious coloring&mdash;purple,
striped with yellow!</p>

<p>“Dey costed me two dollars,” Hitch sighed as
he gazed upon them fondly. “I could swap ’em
off in Sawtown, but I ain’t gwine back dar no more.
Ef I does, some nigger will steal my pants an’ my
socks, too. Plenty of country niggers is got dram.”</p>

<p>He walked barefooted through the woods and
came out at a level plantation some distance back
from the river. In the middle of a cow-pasture,
a tall, brown, bright-eyed negro watched Hitch
approach with impassive curiosity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p>“Howdy, my brudder!” Hitch boomed. “How
am yo’ soul an’ spirit dis day?”</p>

<p>“De spirit is pretty low, elder,” the farmer
replied. “De ole woman am got de dram all
locked up tight.”</p>

<p>“How come you choose de lily-pad route an’
live on water?” Hitch asked in a disappointed
tone.</p>

<p>“I got married,” the young negro responded
with a grin.</p>

<p>Suddenly a big Jersey bull broke through the
underbrush and came toward the two men, snorting,
bellowing, pawing the ground, tossing the dirt
upon his shoulders, and shaking his powerful
head.</p>

<p>“Dat’s mine, stranger,” the young man remarked
proudly, removing the top from a bucket
on his arm and tossing a handful of salt at the
animal’s feet. “He don’t like dat red undershirt
of your’n. Ain’t him a dandy?”</p>

<p>“Shore is,” Hitch said meditatively. After a
moment, he added: “Ef dat ole bull wus to hook
one of us, I ’speck yo’ bride would affode us a
little dram to stimulate us up.”</p>

<p>“I resigns in yo’ favor, elder,” the owner
grinned. “Ef dis here beast wus to butt me, he’d
jolt all my kinnery plum’ back to Afriky.”</p>

<p>There was a period of silent and fruitless
meditation. Then, sorrowfully, Hitch Diamond
reached to his hip-pocket and brought forth his
purple socks with the yellow stripes&mdash;all, except
his trousers, that remained of his former glory.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p>“Whut’s yo’ name?” Hitch asked.</p>

<p>“Dey calls me Dude Blackum because I got a
gold tooth,” the other informed him.</p>

<p>“Whut is yo’ wife called?” Hitch asked next.</p>

<p>“Dainty.”</p>

<p>“I wants to make a little trade, Dude,” Hitch
remarked, after he had told his own name. “Dese
here socks costed me two dollars. My head ain’t
thinkin’ right to-day. You is a heavy thinker.
Ef you kin think up a sketch of how I kin git a
dram right now, I’ll bestow dese here socks on
you.”</p>

<p>“De trade is did!” Dude grinned, showing his
gold tooth. “Lemme think!”</p>

<p>“Bawl out, nigger!” Hitch grumbled after a
little wait. “Don’t keep me waitin’ here in expense
no longer.”</p>

<p>“I wus studyin’ ’bout dis,” Dude said. “I’s
got a little touch of lumbago in my legs. An’
mebbe, ef dat bull would jes’ butt me real easy
like, an’ I’d kinder drap off in dat bayou an’ git
wet, an’ den walk back home in drippy clothes wid
dis mis’ry gnawin’ at my legs&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Hitch’s face was so expressive of contempt
that Dude stopped speaking.</p>

<p>“Is dat whut you call heavy thinkin’?” Hitch
inquired in sarcastic tones. “Dat high-brow
plan might steal you a nubbin of corn from a blind
pig’s slop-trough. But Dainty ain’t no blind pig&mdash;dese
here brides gits awful wise on deir husbunts
atter dey marries ’em.”</p>

<p>“Wait till I finish, Hitch,” Dude begged.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
“Now, my view is dis: you go up to de house an’
cornverse Dainty till I comes in all wet an’
mournin’ ’bout how hurt I is. Atter I come in,
you say to Dainty dat she better gimme a dram
because I’s so crippled up. Of co’se, she will hab
to be manners an’ gib you some, too.”</p>

<p>“Dar, now!” Hitch boomed. “You shore is a
smart boy, Dude. Dat plan is accawdin’ to de
Bible, wise as suppents an’ harmless as ducks.
But”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here Hitch broke off and looked down at his
clothes.</p>

<p>“It ’pears to me it ain’t proper to call on a lady
when I is barefooted an’ ain’t got nothin’ on but a
pair of pants an’ a red undershirt,” he mourned.</p>

<p>“Dat won’t make no diffunce,” Dude assured
him. “All de niggers wucks in de big mill dresses
jes’ like you is now. Dainty will figger dat you is
a sawmill hand. Talk right up to her, Revun”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“I ain’t no preacher!” Hitch interrupted,
growling like an angry bear. “I’s a prize-fighter.”</p>

<p>“Dat won’t do,” Dude chuckled, as he looked
at the giant’s mighty arms and shoulders. “Dainty
is powerful sot on preachers. I ’speck you better
be one as long as you is hangin’ aroun’ her.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Hitch said reluctantly, as he
started away. “I ain’t none too good or too
proud to piddle wid dat job&mdash;ef I got to.”</p>

<p>“Hol’ on, Hitch!” Dude exclaimed. “You
ain’t gimme dem silk socks yit!”</p>

<p>Hitch’s experience in Sawtown had made him
cautious. After a man has parted with a certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
amount of his wearing apparel, he becomes reluctant
to separate himself from the rest in a civilized
community unless he contemplates becoming a he-mermaid
and living in the river.</p>

<p>Hitch held out one sock.</p>

<p>“I’ll gib you one sock now, Dude,” he said
cunningly. “Dat’ll keep yo’ mind int’rusted.
Atter I git de dram, I’ll leave de yuther sock on de
flo’ or de mantlepiece, kinder keerless like.”</p>

<p>Dude accepted the partial payment and stuck
the gaudy sock into his derby hat and placed the
hat on his head.</p>

<p>On his way to the cabin, which lay across the
pasture, Hitch Diamond also did some heavy
thinking.</p>

<p>“I wonder how much dram dat nigger woman is
got,” he muttered to himself. “I bet dar ain’t
enough for two. Ef she ain’t nothin’ but one of
dese here soft, giggly, gal-wifes, mebbe I kin bamboozle
her outen a dram befo’ Dude comes in.”</p>

<p>Dainty met Hitch at the door.</p>

<p>“My name am Hitch Diamond, Dainty,” he
rumbled. “I met Dude out in de cow pasture an’
he tole me he done cormitted mattermony. I felt
powerful bad because he didn’t send fer his ole
preacher frien’ to come ’n’ marrify him. He sont
me up here to take a look at you.”</p>

<p>“Come in, elder,” Dainty giggled. “How is
you feelin’ to-day?”</p>

<p>“Lawd, honey, I feels a whole passel better
since I sot my eyes on you. You’s prettier’n a
little pig. But I been feelin’ powerful sick.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span></p>

<p>“Whut ails you?” the girl asked with instant
sympathy.</p>

<p>“I’s got a wo-begone spasm in my stomick an’ a
empty feelin’ in my head.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s too bad,” Dainty said. “Would a little
drap&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Hitch responded promptly. “Dat’s
jes’ de med’cine I needs. De dorctor obscribes
brandy fer all my ailments.”</p>

<p>Dainty extracted a key from the pocket of her
dress and opened the door of a little storeroom which
contained a little trunk. Drawing forth another
key, she opened the trunk and brought out a jug.</p>

<p>“I’s glad Dude didn’t come to de house wid
you,” Dainty remarked. “I don’t let him hab no
more booze. He come home ’bout two weeks
ago an’ couldn’t git past dat oak tree out dar in dat
yard. He seed two trees whar dar wusn’t but jes’
only one, an’ he mighty nigh butted his fool head
off tryin’ to walk between dem trees.”</p>

<p>She set the jug and the drinking glass beside
Hitch Diamond and took her seat in a rickety hide-bottomed
chair.</p>

<p>Hitch looked at the glass, picked it up and
fumbled it, and set it down apologetically.</p>

<p>“Sister Dainty,” he murmured, “ef you ain’t
got no objections, I’ll drink outen dis jug de way
I wus raised.”</p>

<p>Catching the handle with his left hand, he gave
the jug a quick turn, rested it upon the crook of his
uplifted elbow, and applied his lips to the spout.
Dainty watched him with fascinated eyes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<p>When at last he set the jug upon the table and
seated himself beside it, she said with a chuckle:</p>

<p>“Elder, when I wus a little gal I wus always
countin’&mdash;I used to count de cobs in de feed-trough,
an’ de beans in a hull, an’ de number of
swallers a cow tuck when she drunk water.”</p>

<p>“Jes’ so,” Hitch responded, wiping his mouth on
the sleeve of his red undershirt.</p>

<p>“Seben swallers is a big drink fer a cow, elder,”
Dainty continued.</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Hitch agreed.</p>

<p>“Elder,” Dainty chuckled, “when you wus
drinkin’ outen my jug, you swallered fo’teen
times!”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Hitch replied solemnly. “I tole you
I wus feelin’ powerful sick!”</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered that he was playing
the part of a preacher. He decided he ought to
say something religious. So he began:</p>

<p>“Sister Dainty, dis am de Bible law about de
imbibin’ of awjus liquors: de amount of booze a
man oughter drink depen’s on how much he kin
hold inside hisse’f an’ at de same time resist de
effecks; but, neverdeless an’ howsumever, eve’y
man oughter take a little dram fer his stomick’s
ache in case of powerful sickness.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Dainty agreed.</p>

<p>“Now you notify de case of yo’ husbunt tryin’
to make a goat of hisse’f an’ butt down all de timber
in de yard. I feels like I oughter tell you dat
dat nigger is plum’ full of guile. Right dis minute,
he’s figgerin’ to fall in de bayou an’ come to de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
house all wet, an’ say de bull done butted him, an’
ax fer a leetle drap.”</p>

<p>“Am&mdash;<i>dat</i>&mdash;so?” Dainty inquired with popping
eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Hitch assured her. “Of co’se, a man
in my perfesh don’t harmonize wis no sech plans
like dat. Hit’s a sin ag’in’ de conscience.”</p>

<p>Dainty stood up and laid her hand upon the
handle of the jug.</p>

<p>“I’s gwine put dis jug back in de storeroom.
Dude don’t git none. He is a fraudful nigger!”
She set the jug on the top of the trunk, locked the
storeroom, and went to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Hitch heard her chopping kindling wood and
rattling the stove-lids. He heard the roar of the
fire as the flame from the rich pine-knots soared up
the chimney.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Dainty entered and sat down
with Hitch again, her eyes gleaming with wifely
resolution.</p>

<p>“Dar he comes now!” Hitch snickered, pointing
through the window. “Look at him&mdash;wet as a
b’iled owl an’ walkin’ lame in bofe behime legs like
a stringhalt mule. Lawd, Lawd!”</p>

<h3>IV<br />

A PIPE OF ’BACKY.</h3>

<p>The gate opened and Dude Blackum stumbled
in, walking to the door with every manifestation of
suffering his imagination could devise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>Hitch, standing behind Dainty so she could
not see, encouraged Dude’s painful progress by
waving the other silk purple-and-yellow sock at
him.</p>

<p>“My Lawd, Dainty,” Dude wailed, “whut
you reckin dat ole bull went an’ done to me?”</p>

<p>“Butted you in de bayou!” Dainty answered
promptly.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, dat’s it! I’s cripple in bofe behime
legs fer life!” Dude told her as he clasped his back
with both hands and groaned. “I couldn’t swim
a lick because I couldn’t kick. Ef I hadn’t paddled
out wid my hands I’d ’a’ been drownded.”</p>

<p>He looked appealingly toward Hitch Diamond,
waiting for the bogus elder to suggest the booze.
But Hitch merely wiped his hand across his mouth
and grinned.</p>

<p>“Dainty, honey,” Dude said pleadingly, “I’s
powerful hurted, an’ I feel like I’s gwine hab a
rigger. Ain’t you got a leetle&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shore has,” Dainty replied eagerly, without
waiting for the question. “Git in de yuther room
an’ take off dem wet clothes, an’ by dat time I’ll
hab you a good dram ready.”</p>

<p>With a beatific grin at Hitch Diamond, to
which Hitch responded, Dude retired to change his
clothes. A moment later he came out and said to
Hitch:</p>

<p>“Gimme dat yuther silk sock!”</p>

<p>“A trade am a trade,” Hitch grinned as he
handed it over. “Ain’t one sock wet?”</p>

<p>“Naw!” Dude whispered. “I laid it on de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
groun’ till I jumped in de bayou, an’ I fotch it
home under my hat.”</p>

<p>When Dude reappeared he was clothed in his best
suit and wore the gaudiest socks he had ever owned.</p>

<p>“Set down by dis table, Dude,” Dainty said.</p>

<p>She went to the kitchen, and returned carrying
a bowl, the rank odor of its contents permeating
the room.</p>

<p>“My gawsh, Dainty!” Dude howled as she set
the bowl of steaming liquid before him. “Whut
is dis mess&mdash;a b’iled rat?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” Dainty said in her sweetest tones.
“It’s a bowl of hot sass’fras tea!”</p>

<p>Dude howled his disgust.</p>

<p>“It’s mighty good fer a nigger whut’s had a
accidunt, Dude,” Dainty told him with suspicious
gentleness.</p>

<p>Dude glanced at Hitch Diamond. That gentleman’s
face was set in a monstrous, mouth-stretching
grin, and his eyes danced with unholy glee.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Dude grunted. He sheepishly bent
his head over the bowl of sassafras tea and sipped
its last drop without saying a word.</p>

<p>“Dat fake preacher prize-fighter is done scratched
me out,” he reasoned. “I’ll git even, or die!”</p>

<p>Finishing his tea, Dude rose to his feet. “I’s
gwine out to feed de pigs fer de night, Dainty,”
he said. “I’ll be back in a minute.”</p>

<p>Dude sat down in the door of the corncrib and
meditated deeply upon a proper method of retaliation.</p>

<p>“Dat Hitch Diamond thinks he’s purty blame
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
peart in his head,” he announced to himself. “He
thinks dat he’s got so much sense dat his eyes
looks red.”</p>

<p>He ran his hands deep into his pockets and meditated
some more. Then he shook his head hopelessly.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got nothin’ in my head but squash-seed.
When I tries to ponder, it gibs me blind-staggers in
my brains. I hope, some day, dat nigger will hab
to swaller a whole sassafras-tree!”</p>

<p>He stood up and started slowly back toward the
house. He looked tired and worn. He had most
certainly never heard of Ralph Waldo Emerson,
but he would have agreed with that philosopher in
the statement that “thinking is the hardest work
in the world.”</p>

<p>“I reckin I’ll hab to take dese new socks fer my
pay an’ call it even,” he sighed. “Dar ain’t no
revengeunce comin’ to me. Dainty an’ Hitch is
too much team to pull ag’in.”</p>

<p>He walked into the room where the two sat,
nursing a grouch and by no means disposed to be
courteous to his guest. He took a corn-cob pipe
from his pocket, scratched in the bottom of another
pocket for some crumbs of smoking tobacco, and
lighted up.</p>

<p>“Dude is got anodder pipe, elder. Would you
wish to smoke?” Dainty inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Hitch responded. “It’ll kinder sottle
my stomick fer my supper vittles.”</p>

<p>Dude arose grumpily, walked to the mantle
shelf, and picked up a pipe. Out of one pocket
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
he brought a few crumbs of smoking tobacco, then
scraped the bottom of another pocket for a few
more crumbs. He emptied some papers and matches
and pieces of string out of a mug on the mantle,
and poured out a few more crumbs. Then, behind
a picture, his eyes caught the gleam of metal, and
he brought out something which looked like a flask.
He poured a few crumbs out of this into his hand,
finished filling the pipe as he turned his back,
and reached for a match. Passing them to Hitch,
Dude took his chair on the far side of the room near
the open door.</p>

<p>Hitch struck the match and sucked the flame
into the bowl of his pipe.</p>

<p><i>Pow!</i></p>

<p>The pipe burst into fragments, the room filled
with smoke, Dainty screamed, and Hitch Diamond
performed a number of interesting circus stunts
and tumbled over in a squalling, bellowing heap
upon the floor.</p>

<p>“Git de booze, Dainty!” Dude screamed.
“Fotch out de jug! De elder is done cormitted
death!”</p>

<p>Dainty sprang to the storeroom door, opened it,
and handed Dude the jug.</p>

<p>“Oo-oo-ee!” Hitch whooped. “I’s dyin’ dead!”</p>

<p>“Go in de kitchen an’ fotch a drinkin’ cup!”
Dude howled to his wife.</p>

<p>Dainty bounced into the kitchen, slamming
the door behind her. Dude quickly latched the
door so that Dainty could not enter the room
again without going entirely around the house.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span></p>

<p>“Oo-oo-ee!” Hitch Diamond howled. “He’p!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you ole fool!” Dude commanded as
he walked over and bestowed upon the giant prize-fighter
a most earnest and soul-satisfying kick.
“Me an’ dis jug ain’t gwine ’socheate wid you no
more. You ain’t fitten comp’ny!”</p>

<p>“Don’t leave me, Dude!” Hitch begged. “I’s
all collapsed down!”</p>

<p>Dude picked up his derby hat, stopped at the
door, and looked back:</p>

<p>“Sass’fras tea is mighty good fer a nigger whut’s
had a accidunt, Hitch. Dainty makes it fine!
Atter she fixes you a bowl I advises you to fill anodder
pipe wid gunpowder outen dat flask behime dat
picture an’ take anodder smoke. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>Dainty came running around the house and
entered the door. She was mad.</p>

<p>“Whut made you lock me out, elder?” she
demanded.</p>

<p>“Dude done it,” Hitch mourned, sitting upon
the floor and feeling much better after learning what
had caused his pipe to explode. “Dude is went!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lawdy!” Dainty exclaimed. “Go an’
fotch him back, elder! He’ll be so drunk in no
time dat he won’t know whut end of hisse’f is
straight up! Go!”</p>

<p>Hitch went. His intentions were good. He
really desired to find Dude, because Dude had the
jug. He purposed to hunt for him. But a man
who has had fourteen swallows out of a jug of free
whisky twenty minutes before cannot be expected
to maintain a given purpose very long.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<p>By the time Hitch had crossed the pasture, he
needed all the woods along the river for walking
room. The entire width of the levee was not too
much to accommodate his devious journey back
toward Sawtown.</p>

<p>On the edge of the town, near the commissary
store of the big sawmill, he found a most interesting
ditch. It was about ten feet wide and fifteen
feet deep, and was hard and dry at the bottom.</p>

<p>He leaned over to examine that ditch with great
care. He seemed to want to remember it, to
impress it on his mind. It may fairly be presumed
that he did impress it on his mind. He fell into it
on his head.</p>

<p>At midnight he was sleeping in it undisturbed.
A little after midnight something happened. A
man walking down the deep gulley stepped on
Hitch Diamond and woke him up.</p>

<h3>V<br />

AMONG THIEVES.</h3>

<p>Hitch did not know how long he lay in the
ditch after he had been awakened. He tried to
remember where he was and how he got there, but
he was half asleep and wholly confused, and the
task was too great for him.</p>

<p>What woke him up completely was a long, shrill
whistle, followed by four pistol-shots in rapid
succession.</p>

<p>Hitch sprang to his feet and started running
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
down the gulley, but he stumbled in the dark and
fell headlong.</p>

<p>Three more pistol-shots cracked in the still night
air, a man screamed, and Hitch sprang up and
started again. He stumbled and fell a second
time.</p>

<p>Over in the far end of the big lumber yard a
second whistle shrilled, the call of a night watchman,
followed by the <i>crack! crack! crack!</i> of an
automatic pistol. Then the big mill whistle
roared its warning through the town and reverberated
down the river and echoed from the woods,
and deafened and terrified Hitch Diamond by its
sinister call to the people of Sawtown to rouse
themselves.</p>

<p>From the great number of little houses where the
employees of the mill lived men issued forth,
brandishing firearms and calling to each other as
they ran. The electric lights in the mill flashed
up, and in a brief time an immense crowd had
congregated.</p>

<p>Hitch could hear their excited questions and
answers.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Commissary store has been robbed and night
watchman killed!”</p>

<p>“Who did it?”</p>

<p>“A nigger!”</p>

<p>“No! Two niggers!”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence while the crowd
considered this. Then a roar:</p>

<p>“Find them niggers and mob ’em! Come on!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>

<p>“Spread out, men! Cover the yard! Look
everywhere!”</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond turned his back on that crowd
and started in the opposite direction at full speed,
running in the dark, with no notion where he was
going. He got an idea when he plunged into the
mill-pond up to his neck.</p>

<p>“Dis here is sloppy wuck!” he grunted as he
climbed out of there.</p>

<p>He began to skirt the edge of the pond, and
found to his alarm that he was following the curve
which led him back to the lighted mill. He heard
the sound of running feet; a flash-light shot its rays
across the mill-pond, and Hitch departed from
the water’s edge with all possible speed.</p>

<p>He found one of the long alleys between the
lumber piles in the yard and sprinted down the
sawdust trail at a lively gait.</p>

<p>Glancing back over his shoulder, he found the
entrance of the alley filled with men who were
coming toward him with incredible swiftness.
The employees of the mill were familiar with all
the main thoroughfares and by-paths of the yard,
while Hitch had to feel his way to some extent, and
his progress was necessarily slow.</p>

<p>A revolver spat fire and lead at him, a fusillade
followed, a big lumber-stack rose like a mountain
before the frightened negro, and he fell against it
with both hands outspread.</p>

<p>He found something that he had never noticed
in a lumber yard before&mdash;that strips of wood were
thrust between the layers of lumber to give a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
circulation of air and prevent the lumber from
rotting.</p>

<p>These little gaps made it possible for him to
climb, and he scrambled up the pile like a big
baboon and lay on the top, panting like the exhaust
of an engine.</p>

<p>His pursuers passed the pile on the path below,
and Hitch began to breathe easier.</p>

<p>In a moment a light flashed from a big lumber-pile
fifty feet away and several feet higher than
the pile he was on. A watchman was whipping
about him with a dark lantern, searching the top
of the lumber.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond dropped over the side and hit
the sawdust trail again. He ran down a little by-path,
skinning his elbows upon the projecting
planks and stubbing his bare toes against all kinds
of obstacles, until he fell over something and
tumbled onto something with a clatter like the roll
of a snare-drum.</p>

<p>A man loomed up before him not twenty feet
away and said “Ho!” in a frightened voice.</p>

<p>Hitch got up and went away from that place
with astonishing speed.</p>

<p>Then the watchman on the lumber-pile threw
the rays of his dark lantern down into the runway
just as Hitch passed, and the terrified negro ran
full into the glare.</p>

<p>Three pistol-shots splintered the wood around
him as he ran on; the watchman’s sharp voice
called to the man-hunters, and in a second, hundreds
of men had turned and were converging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
toward the spot where Hitch Diamond was running
around a lumber-pile like a trapped rabbit.</p>

<p>“Guard the runways, men!” the watchman’s
voice ordered sharply. “I’ll flash the light into
the alleys for you!”</p>

<p>The watchman began to leap from pile to pile,
throwing the rays of his dark lantern down into
each corridor, and coming constantly closer to
where Hitch Diamond was hiding.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” Hitch chattered as he looked up
at the fantastic, mountainous pile beside which
he was crouched.</p>

<p>Salvation came with the thought that the pile
he stood beside was higher than the one on which
the watchman stood. He began to climb, hand
over hand, praying that the light would not reach
him before he could attain the summit.</p>

<p>By the mercy of Heaven he rolled onto the top
of the lumber just as the watchman, on a pile
twenty feet below him, flashed the glare into the
corridor where Hitch had stood a moment before.</p>

<p>Hitch was blowing like a bellows, streams of
perspiration poured down his body, and his giant
frame shook like the body of a man with an ague.</p>

<p>Days of dissipation in New Orleans, a drunken
spree just a few hours before, nothing to eat since
breakfast, half an hour of violent exercise running
and climbing lumber, and a fright which clutched
at his heart, weakening and almost suffocating him&mdash;all
of these things were handicaps for Hitch Diamond
in the effort he was making to escape.</p>

<p>He knew that capture meant certain death.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
Capture was not even necessary&mdash;a flash of light, a
well-directed pistol-shot, and his career was ended.</p>

<p>Suddenly his soul was filled with terror.</p>

<p>Twenty men had mounted the lumber-piles and
were moving across the tops, lashing the lumber
with their lights, driving everything before them
as a woman shoos a lot of chickens. Below him,
on the ground, men were standing at the end of
each main thoroughfare, and were lashing them
with light, while one man was walking down
each by-path!</p>

<p>The searching party had organized, and was
moving with perfect precision to cover the entire
yard.</p>

<p>“Good-by, fair worl’!” Hitch Diamond mourned
as he crawled to the edge of the lumber and looked
down. “’Tain’t no hope fer pore old Hitchie
onless I kin hop offen dis lumber atter dat man
is done passed down in de alley.”</p>

<p>But the men on the ground had foreseen that
possibility, and were measuring their progress
down the by-paths by the progress of the men
on the lumber-piles.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Hitch Diamond’s heart turned to
lead, his blood to water, and his giant frame
seemed to crumble like chalk. Already he felt
himself mortally stricken and dying.</p>

<p>He caught himself trying to speak, to utter
words of encouragement to himself, but his teeth
clicked together like castanets, and his whispered
words fell upon terror-deafened ears.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet and stood glaring at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
approaching lights like some great beast trapped
in a jungle. Unconsciously he shut his fingers
tight, his hands forming two immense iron fists.</p>

<p>That unconscious action made a man of him
again! Those iron fists were the fists of a prize-fighter&mdash;Hitch
Diamond, the Tickfall Tiger! Courage
flowed through his veins like some magic
liquor.</p>

<p>“Hitch never th’ows up de sponge!” he growled.
“I fights to de eend!”</p>

<h3>VI<br />

THE TICKFALL TIGER STRIKES.</h3>

<p>Hitch sat down upon the lumber-pile and
slipped quietly over the edge, preparing to descend.</p>

<p>He hung the seat of his trousers upon a splinter
and lunged forward in a sudden panic, tearing
the garment almost off his body.</p>

<p>As he climbed quietly down the side of the pile,
he hung the leg of his trousers upon a projecting
stick and ripped the leg almost up to the waistband.
Dropping down upon the sawdust path, he
took a step or two and found that his torn pantaloons
hindered his progress, and might afford his
pursuers a hand-hold for his capture.</p>

<p>Sorrowfully he took the garment off and stood
in his giant strength, panoplied in his red underclothes!</p>

<p>“There he goes!” a voice called in the dark.</p>

<p>Clenching his iron fists, Hitch started at full
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
speed. Ten men blocked the entrance before
him. He went through them like an express-train,
rolling some of them heels over head.</p>

<p>A man ran out of a by-path, and his head collided
with Hitch’s fist like a punching-bag. As the
negro ran another, another, and another came
out of the little pathways, and each one went down
like a bag of salt. Thus Hitch arrived at the
main passageway.</p>

<p>Then he found every by-path pouring forth its
quota of men, every thoroughfare contributed
its number, and every man upon the lumber-piles
ran toward one spot to illumine the passage with
their dark lanterns.</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy!” Hitch sighed. “Ef I don’t
mix wid ’em, dey’ll shoot me!”</p>

<p>To the end of their lives, those powerful, husky
sawmill men told with awe-stricken voices of the
fight of that giant black in the lumber yard. Hitch
mixed with them. No man dared to use his pistol
for fear of killing a friend. It was a hand-to-hand
battle, one negro against forty mill-hands.</p>

<p>With a wild, insane bellow Hitch hurled himself
upon that mob of cursing, shrieking, clambering,
clutching men, and they set upon him like ravening
wolves.</p>

<p>The confusion was terrible, the noise was deafening,
the shout and the tumult of the battle echoing
back from the mountains of lumber. Hitch alone
seemed to have a clear idea of his battle&mdash;he knew
that every man was against him. The others
hindered each other, but Hitch knew that he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
free to knock any nose and pound any head and
butt any stomach.</p>

<p>The proximity of the lumber on each side of the
thoroughfare was an aid to Hitch. When he
hurled his mighty body into a crowd of his opponents,
and they reeled back from the impact and
struck the backs of their heads against the wood,
it took them a few minutes to recover from the
shock, while Hitch gave his attention to others.</p>

<p>His giant fists pounded heads as though they
were egg-shells; his ponderous bare feet landed
with mighty kicks in the stomachs and the backs
of men; his long, iron arms whirled like the wings
of a windmill, mowing them down, every man who
was touched falling unconscious or helpless.</p>

<p>Four men clung to him like cockleburs to a
sheep’s wool, trying to drag him down by their
weight. Hitch scooped them up in his mighty
arms and fell with their combined weight against a
pile of lumber, crushing them and breaking their
holds.</p>

<p>An excited watchman on a lumber-pile above
him sought to contribute a share to the battle
by dropping upon Hitch’s head a girder or joist
such as is used in constructing the framework of
houses. The piece of timber fell ten feet from
Hitch’s struggling body, and he set his hand upon
it with a bellow of joy.</p>

<p>In that moment Hitch became another Goliath,
the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam,
and whose spear’s head weighed six hundred
shekels of iron.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span></p>

<p>When Hitch began to lay about him with that
joist the battle was won. The foolish watchman
who had contributed such a mighty weapon to the
enemy was so astonished that he fell, clattering, off
the lumber-pile and broke his arm.</p>

<p>The men charged him once more, but Hitch
waved his big piece of timber from side to side,
mowing them down. A pistol-shot from the top of
the lumber warned Hitch that it was time to leave.</p>

<p>A loud, disappointed wail sounded from the top
of the lumber, where the men were operating the
dark lanterns, and instantly began the crack,
crack, crack of the pistols, shooting at Hitch as
he ran down the corridor.</p>

<p>Men still arriving, coming in from other by-paths
and avenues between the lumber, scrambled
out of Hitch’s way, fearful of being shot from
above.</p>

<p>Hitch found a clear path and took it. In a little
while he was out of range of the bullets and out of
the glare of the lights. He scrambled over a low
fence, and found himself in a side street outside of
the lumber yard.</p>

<p>“Hey, men!” a triumphant voice shrieked.
“Here he is! We’ve got him! Come on! We’ve
caught him!”</p>

<p>Shriek after shriek arose from the middle of
the lumber yard, accompanied by the triumphant
voices repeating:</p>

<p>“We’ve got him!”</p>

<p>“Dey ain’t got me!” Hitch grinned as he
looked over his shoulder at the flashing lights
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
which were converging at another point on top of
the lumber. “I’s gwine drap down an’ rest a
minute; den I’s gwine take dis red suit of underclothes
to Tickfall, an’ git some pants an’ a coat
to put on over it.”</p>

<p>He dropped down in a thicket of plum-trees,
completely exhausted. While he rested he listened.</p>

<p>“Kill him!”</p>

<p>“Befo’ Gawd, white folks, I ain’t done nothin’,
nothin’!”</p>

<p>“Knock him over the head with that jug and
make him shut up!”</p>

<p>A loud scream and silence!</p>

<p>“I wonder whut road goes back to Tickfall?”
Hitch whispered with fear-stiffened lips. “One
dead nigger is more’n a plenty!”</p>

<p>Skirting the edge of the town to be out of the
electric lights, Hitch Diamond sought the way
to the river. With him every place was either up
or down that great stream, and he remembered
that Tickfall was up the river.</p>

<p>When he found the levee and stood looking out
upon the dark water so great was his confusion
that he was unable to tell which way the stream
was flowing.</p>

<p>He heard behind him the shouts of the approaching
mob, punctuated now and then by the terrible
screams of a man being led out of the woods to
suffer death. He shuddered and wondered that
any man could make as much noise with his throat
as did this terrified negro in the hands of the mob.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<p>A moment later there was no question in Hitch’s
mind which way the Mississippi River was flowing,
for Hitch was swimming noiselessly across the
current toward the opposite shore. But the
Father of Waters is no quiet mill-pond. The
pressure of its mighty current is the push of every
drop of water falling between the Rockies and the
Alleghanies and the inflow of the rivers between.
That current carried Hitch down the stream, in
spite of his most powerful efforts to resist it.</p>

<p>Several men ran out on the levee and threw their
lantern rays across the water.</p>

<p>Hitch promptly turned on his back and floated,
riding the current as motionless as a log. When
the light left the water, Hitch struggled on, fighting
the dark, muddy stream.</p>

<p>Suddenly the water swept him against one of
the immense cypress braces of the revetment levee.
He seized it, almost dead with weariness. He
realized that he was not twenty feet from the shore
he had left, and but a short distance from the mob.
But this revetment offered a hiding place, and he
grasped it eagerly.</p>

<p>The voices of the mob came to him distinctly
across the water.</p>

<p>“Befo’ Gawd, white folks, you-alls ain’t got me
right!” the hopeless captive wailed. “I ain’t
done nothin’ a-tall! All you white mens knows
Dude Blackum&mdash;dat’s me! I lives in de cabin jest
up ferninst de mill-pond, an’ wucks on a farm fer
my livin’!”</p>

<p>“Shut up!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>The crowd which had fought and been defeated
by Hitch Diamond was in no mood to listen to the
explanations of another negro. A long, wailing
cry was Dude Blackum’s answer, and the mob
moved on.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a whoop, a clatter of pistol
shots, a howling mob swarming over the levee, a
splash of water, and a number of voices:</p>

<p>“Catch him! Head him off there! Kill him!”</p>

<p>A number of flash-lights whipped the water, and
one big lantern shot a broad, blinding, dangerous
streak. That flare of light caught the round, black
head, swimming, struggling in the current, and
held it.</p>

<p>“Now, men!” a voice called. “There’s your
mark&mdash;shoot straight!”</p>

<p>There was a fusillade&mdash;Hitch Diamond noted
with elation that the black, woolly head bobbed
on.</p>

<p>“Fer Gawd’s sake!” Hitch murmured. “Why
don’t dat coon dive an’ float?”</p>

<p>Suddenly an authoritative voice cried:</p>

<p>“Stop shooting, men! Get in your skiffs and
row out there and catch that negro! It’ll take him
half an hour to swim the river!”</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” Hitch Diamond moaned. “Little
Hitchie is shore up ag’in it now!”</p>

<p>“Hurry, men!” the same authoritative voice
called.</p>

<p>There was the sound of running feet along the
levee, then a moment of breathless silence while
the flash-lights lashed the water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<p>Then far out into the stream there was a loud
scream, a loud splash, and silence!</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Hitch mourned. “De water
cramps got him! He’s dead!”</p>

<p>The lights of the lanterns searched everywhere.
No black object floated, nothing at all was seen.</p>

<p>The same clear, authoritative voice spoke again,
and a tone of sadness softened it:</p>

<p>“I guess that’s all, men! We may as well go
home now!”</p>

<p>“I’s gwine home, too!” Hitch Diamond whimpered
piteously.</p>

<h3>VII<br />

GOING HOME.</h3>

<p>He climbed down the levee, after battling his
way across the river, found a public highway on
the other side, and stepped into the middle of
the road. Looking about him cautiously, he
inflated his lungs with air. After that he dropped
his hands to his sides and began a steady and persistent
trot, his feet striking the sand with the
monotonous regularity of a ticking clock, each
stride carrying him away from the scene of his
adventure.</p>

<p>Hour after hour, as persistent as a desert camel,
Hitch moved ahead, his breath like a husky bellows,
his body pain-shot from his many wounds.</p>

<p>By early dawn he was miles away, tortured by
hunger and compelled to face the fact that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
could not go to a house and beg for food, nor could
he forage in the daylight for lack of clothes.</p>

<p>“Lawd,” Hitch mourned. “Ef I ever git back
to Tickfall, I’s gwine git on de water-wagon, an’
cut out de booze. I’ll cut out prize-fightin’,
cussin’, an’ trabelin’ aroun’. I’ll git me a good,
easy job ’thout much work to do, an’ rest my bones
till I die!”</p>

<p>As the first faint streaks which marked the
rising of the sun shot across the sky, Hitch left
the road and walked toward the river.</p>

<p>He entered some deep woods and crawled into
a thicket of small trees which were heavily draped
with muscadine vines. Dragging these vines
down and packing them around him so that they
made a complete covering, he lay flat on the
ground and slept like a dead man until darkness
came again.</p>

<p>When Hitch awoke he could see the dim outlines
of the river levee, and he started toward it,
every muscle stiff and aching and crying for more
rest.</p>

<p>“I’s gwine git over on my own side of dis river
befo’ I fergits whut side I b’longs on,” he soliloquized.
“Bad luck is hittin’ me too fast fer
me to take any chances!”</p>

<p>Weak from hunger and weariness, with his
strength bound by his stiff and aching muscles,
the current carried Hitch almost a mile down the
stream before he could battle his way across.</p>

<p>When he landed he lay for an hour upon the
shore, hardly able to move. At last he started,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
going away from the river until he found the public
road, then turned to the right and started forward
on a steady trot.</p>

<p>Daylight found him twenty-seven miles nearer
Tickfall, and the third day had begun for him
without food. Hunger gnawed at his stomach
with the teeth of death.</p>

<p>As he approached the woods where he expected
to hide for the day, he noticed a thin column of
smoke rising above the branches of the trees.</p>

<p>“Ef I kin find dat fire in de woods, an’ some
nigger is watchin’ it, I won’t hab no trouble,”
Hitch muttered. “Dey’ll onderstan’ dat I’s done
had troubles an’ dey’ll git me some pants an’ somepin
to eat.”</p>

<p>He crept into the timber and began to walk
slowly and cautiously toward the place where he
thought he had located the smoke.</p>

<p>It was much farther than he had estimated, and
he crawled and crept for a long time before he
reached it.</p>

<p>Some one had cooked food there, for an old
tin can was still redolent of boiled coffee; there
were the feathers of a chicken, and the scales of a
fish, and the crumbs of bread.</p>

<p>Moaning to himself like a wounded animal,
Hitch dropped upon all fours and picked up every
crumb of bread, and sucked the remaining sustenance
from every chicken and fish bone which had
been cast aside, and drained every drop of coffee
from the empty can.</p>

<p>Then he heard a noise behind him and turned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
to gaze into the scarred, black, masklike face of
Dinner Gaze.</p>

<p>Hitch was not at all surprised to see some negro
from Sawtown hiding in the woods. In fact, he
knew if the negro who built the fire was a traveler
he had very likely come from that mill town.</p>

<p>The proverb that the wicked flee when no man
pursueth does not apply to the negro in the South.
However innocent he may be of crime, he desires
to depart from a place where there has been trouble
between the negroes and the whites. If he is a
transient like Hitch Diamond, or his occupation
is rather questionable, like the gambling-house of
Dinner Gaze, he is sure to leave at the earliest
opportunity and go where he has friends or where
the white people who know him will defend him
from harm.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dinner!” Hitch exclaimed.</p>

<p>Dinner’s black, beadlike eyes glowed unwinkingly.</p>

<p>“I thought they kilt you in de river, Revun,”
he muttered in his soft, easy voice.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, dey wusn’t atter me,” Hitch said
with difficulty, feeling a great weakness and
nausea come over him. “Dey kotch Dude
Blackum an’ Dude escaped away. He sunk while
he was swimmin’ in de river.”</p>

<p>“Did de mob tear all yo’ clothes off?” Dinner
Gaze asked.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh; I had bad luck an’ loss all my clothes
befo’ dat happened. Dat’s how come I got to
trabbel at night.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

<p>“Is you hongry?” Gaze asked.</p>

<p>“Ain’t had nothin’ fer two days, an’ dis is de
beginnin’ of de nex’ day,” Hitch told him.</p>

<p>Dinner Gaze picked up a small handsatchel
which he had set down at his feet and prepared to
leave.</p>

<p>“I’s sorry you didn’t git here in time fer breakfast,
Revun,” he said. “Ef you’ll stay right here
I’ll go git you some ole clothes an’ a little vittles.
I kin beg ’em from some white folks’s house.”</p>

<p>“I’s mighty nigh dead wid bein’ so hongry,
Dinner,” Hitch pleaded. “Ef you’ll he’p me
outen dis scrape I’ll shore love you ferever.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be oneasy,” Dinner grinned. “I’ll
he’p you as much as I kin.”</p>

<p>Dinner may have intended to aid Hitch, but that
portion of Tickfall Parish was scantily inhabited.
He walked several miles before he came to a
human habitation, and there he was refused both
food and clothes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Hitch had said enough to cause
any man to suspect that he was implicated in the
Sawtown murder, and negroes are afraid to render
aid and comfort to criminals, even of their own
race.</p>

<p>Hitch waited for several hours, and finally fell
asleep, dreaming of all the things he had ever seen
or heard of that were good to eat. He awoke
at nightfall, famished. Dinner Gaze had not returned.</p>

<p>“Dat nigger lied to me!” Hitch exclaimed
desperately. “Ef I had him here I’d kill him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
wid my bare hands. Ef I ever git de chance to
even up, I’ll do it ef I die!”</p>

<p>Cursing his misfortunes, he arose and stumbled
weakly forward.</p>

<p>Two days later Hitch Diamond stumbled up the
steps of the little cabin at the Gaitskill hog-camp,
seven miles from Tickfall. He fell unconscious
at the feet of old Isaiah Gaitskill, the negro overseer.</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” Isaiah exclaimed, clawing at his
white wool. “Wharever Hitch has been at, he
comed away so fast dat he runned out of all his
clothes!”</p>

<h3>VIII<br />

THE HOODOO GIRL.</h3>

<p>It was Sunday morning in Tickfall. A crowd
of men were standing in front of the Shoofly
Church, idly waiting and chewing tobacco. A
row of men sat like buzzards upon the top of
the rickety fence, also chewing tobacco. Half a
dozen saddle-horses stood hitched to the trees
and two-score dilapidated buggies stood in a row
with their horses hitched to the fence.</p>

<p>Now and then some young negro girl wandered
aimlessly toward one of these buggies, then hastened
her footsteps as if she had just remembered
leaving something under the seat.</p>

<p>Some young negro man quickly ceased his low-toned
conversation and watched her out of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
corner of his eye. Presently the girl climbed into
the buggy and sat down. Promptly the young
man left his companions and went and sat beside
her. That was the end of their interest in the
services to be conducted in the church that
morning.</p>

<p>The young man had found the saint of his
deepest devotion.</p>

<p>The Rev. Vinegar Atts came stalking across the
churchyard like a turkey walking through mud
and dressed in all his Sunday finery. None of the
men seemed to be aware of his presence. Vinegar
reflected on the strangeness of this, and began
to ponder uneasily on his chance of retaining his
job as the preacher at the Shoofly Church.</p>

<p>He bowed and spoke to all the men, and hardly
one of them gave him a nod of recognition in return.</p>

<p>Vinegar determined to find out the cause of this
indifference, and he chose for his informant a man
named Pap Curtain&mdash;a tall, slim negro with a
yellow monkey face and an habitual sneer upon his
lips.</p>

<p>“Whut ails you niggers to-day?” Vinegar
demanded in a trembling voice. “How come dis
here awful silence aroun’ dis church?”</p>

<p>“Hoodoo gal!” Pap Curtain answered laconically,
pointing across the churchyard.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Vinegar grunted with popping eyes.</p>

<p>On the other side of the yard old Ginny Babe
Chew, a woman of immense size, was walking
beside a slim young negress dressed in white and
very handsome.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>“Huh,” Vinegar grunted again, unable to
comprehend.</p>

<p>“How much will you gib me fer a piece of real
news, Revun?” Pap inquired.</p>

<p>“Ef you got any tales to tell, bawl out!” Vinegar
snapped, for the men’s actions were getting
on his nerves.</p>

<p>“You remember hearin’ ’bout dat Dude Blackum
whut got into trouble wid de white folks at
Sawtown las’ Monday night?” Pap asked. “Well,
suh, dat little gal wid Ginny Babe Chew is Dainty
Blackum, Dude’s cote-house wife!”</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” Vinegar growled as he sat down
upon the ground under a tree like a man suddenly
overcome by weakness. He pulled out his corn-cob
pipe and gave himself up to troubled meditation
as he filled and lighted it. After a few
moments he said:</p>

<p>“Pap, de niggers never will git over deir skeer
’bout dat little entertainment wid Dude Blackum.
I don’t b’lieve he done whut de white folks said he
done.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” Pap cautioned. Then he asked:
“Whut diffunce do dat make now? He’s done
dead!”</p>

<p>There was a long silence while the two men
watched the handsome, graceful girl walking beside
the elephantine form of Ginny Babe Chew.
Finally Pap Curtain said aloud as if to himself:</p>

<p>“She’s tall an’ wavy like a stalk of sugar-cane,
an’ sweet plum down to de groun’.”</p>

<p>“She ain’t mournin’ so powerful deep fer dat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
Dude Blackum,” Vinegar remarked. “She’s dolled
up in a white dress!”</p>

<p>“Dat Dude Blackum shore did lose somepin
beside his life when he parted wid dat female
woman,” Pap said. “Ef I could hab a gal like
dat keepin’ house fer me, I’d shore cut out all
meanness ferever.”</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts shuddered and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“I ain’t waste no time talkin’ ’bout dead niggers,”
he said uneasily. “I done seed de ghost of
dat Dude Blackum ’bout fo’teen times.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t by yo’se’f in dat, Revun,” Pap
sighed. “Eve’y time I thinks of dat nigger I gits
de jiggety-jams.”</p>

<p>“I knowed Dude Blackum a little bit&mdash;I seed
him on de train once,” Vinegar said. “But
’pears like his ha’nt ain’t gwine let me alone
a-tall!”</p>

<p>Dainty and Ginny Babe walked up the steps
and entered the Shoofly Church, followed by the
curious eyes of all the men in the yard.</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Vinegar mourned. “’Tain’t no
use to try to hab preachin’ dis mawnin’&mdash;dat hoodoo
gal is done got dis meetin’-house in a mess. I
feels like somebody is done criss-crossed my head
wid a rabbit-foot.”</p>

<p>He knocked the tobacco from his pipe and
thrust it into his pocket, his eyes set upon the door
through which the girl had passed.</p>

<p>“When did Dainty Blackum come to Tickfall?”
Vinegar asked.</p>

<p>“Yistiddy. Ginny Babe Chew met her at de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
deppo. Some yuther niggers come up from Sawtown,
too. You know how niggers is&mdash;dar’s a
scatteration when somepin like dat happens.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. De guilty niggers scatterates as
fur as dey kin git an’ as quick as dey kin go,”
Vinegar agreed. “De not guilty niggers hikes out
of de place to de near-by towns an’ waits till de
clouds rolls by.”</p>

<p>“I’s jes’ whisperin’ to you ’bout dat Dainty
Blackum, Vinegar,” Pap said suddenly. “I ain’t
gwine ’round braggin’ no brags ’bout knowin’ dis
Blackum gal. White folks gits awful rambunctious
when a nigger kills a white man like Dude
done.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t sayin’ nothin’,” Vinegar murmured.
“I done j’ined de lodge of silunce.”</p>

<p>The two men separated, Vinegar enterin’ the
large, cool, dilapidated church. The band of men
standing in the yard followed, as a drove of mules
follow a gray mare upon the dusty highroad. The
buzzard-like men climbed from their perches on
the fence, dusted the seats of their trousers by
quick, sliding motions of each hand, and entered
the building. In the intense silence their heavily
shod feet made ugly noises upon the uncarpeted
floor.</p>

<p>Vinegar sensed tragedy everywhere. He looked
around him uneasily, spotting certain unfamiliar
faces in the congregation.</p>

<p>Ginny Babe Chew sat on the front seat with
Dainty Blackum, the two occupying the middle
row of pews. On Vinegar’s right, on the front
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
seat, sat a man who had a knife-scar in his neck, a
bullet-scar on his cheek, and the top of his left ear
was missing. On Vinegar’s left was a tall, ladder-headed
negro, dressed like a preacher, sitting on a
front bench.</p>

<p>There was no organ or other musical instrument
in the church. Vinegar Atts, who had a voice like
a pipe-organ, always raised his own tunes and
depended upon Skeeter Butts, Figger Bush, and
Hitch Diamond to carry the music in the congregation.</p>

<p>Vinegar looked in vain for his three friends
to-day. Hitch Diamond had been gone for three
Sundays; Skeeter Butts was organizing a baseball
nine, and Figger Bush had gone away with a
fishing-party of white people.</p>

<p>Suddenly the voice of Dinner Gaze, sitting on
Vinegar’s right, rose loud and clear in the silence:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“On de yuther side of Jordon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In de sweet fields of Eden,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whar de Tree of Life is bloomin’,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Dar is rest fer you!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No one in the congregation knew the song, and
the solo-voice floated out like the song of a bird.
The people sat with bowed heads and listened.
When the song ended Vinegar walked out of the
pulpit and extended his hand cordially to Dinner
Gaze.</p>

<p>“Glad to meet yo’ ’quaintance, my brudder!”
he rumbled. “Will you h’ist de toons fer us?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

<h3>IX<br />

DINNER GAZE SINGS.</h3>

<p>Dinner Gaze rose from his seat and, stooping
as if he were trying to catch a rat, walked to the
front of the congregation. Pausing a moment,
his body began to weave to and fro as if in conformity
to the words of Scripture: “All my bones
shall praise thee.” Then to the surprise of the
congregation, after all this orthodox preparation
for starting a tune, Dinner Gaze suddenly walked
back to his former place and sat down! In the
meantime Vinegar Atts was getting acquainted
with the other stranger on the opposite side of
the house.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, my name is Tucky Sugg,” the
stranger told him. “I ain’t no reg’lar preacher,
but I exhausts a little befo’ de people sometimes.”</p>

<p>“I hopes you’ll take up yo’ stayin’-place wid us,”
Vinegar said cordially. “Us needs good mens.”</p>

<p>He turned to motion to Dinner Gaze to start the
song, and found that Dinner had gone back to his
seat.</p>

<p>“Whut ails you, brudder?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’s skeart I don’t know enough toons to lead de
singin’,” Gaze said with a grin. “I retires.”</p>

<p>Vinegar’s eyes fell upon Ginny Babe Chew.</p>

<p>“H’ist a toon, sister!” he commanded. In a
hoarse bellow Ginny Babe began:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Blow&mdash;ye&mdash;de&mdash;trumpet&mdash;blow&mdash;&mdash;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span></p>

<p>One line was enough.</p>

<p>The words were not inspiring, the tune and tone
and manner of the fat leader was a call to penitence,
anguish, and tears.</p>

<p>Vinegar sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Dat’s won’t do, sister!” he interrupted. “Less
sing <i>dis</i> toon!”</p>

<p>He began a song in a bellow which shook
the rafters of the house and rattled the windows
and threatened to crumble the foundations
of the building. The song was a jay-bird affair,
waltz-music to the stanza and jig-time to
the chorus. The song might as well have been
totally unfamiliar to the congregation. It was
really one of their favorites&mdash;but, in spite
of that, they let Vinegar sing it through as a
solo.</p>

<p>Verily, the hoodoo was working.</p>

<p>Vinegar was appalled at the unresponsiveness of
his congregation, and when the crowd had listened
without objection or commendation to a solo
prayer and to a reading from the old, worn Bible
upon the desk, the preacher was almost in
hysterics. He had never seen anything like
that before.</p>

<p>Vinegar turned to Ginny Babe Chew a second
time and said desperately:</p>

<p>“Now, sister Ginny, less hab anodder song&mdash;a
lively toon whut eve’ybody knows!”</p>

<p>Ginny Babe Chew rose to her feet, her hand
started the gestures of an old-fashioned singing-master,
her body “weaved,” her voice arose in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
high, drawling falsetto, utterly unlike her natural
tone:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Blow&mdash;ye&mdash;de&mdash;trumpet&mdash;blow&mdash;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the human eye had power to slay, Ginny Babe
would now be dead. Vinegar Atts glared at her
with such a murderous look that the congregation
forgot to sing and watched him. Ginny Babe
turned and gazed at the preacher with the air of a
hurt child, and quietly took her seat.</p>

<p>There was continued silence in the congregation.</p>

<p>Vinegar raised another tune:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I muss tell de good Lawd all of my trials,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I cannot bear dese here burdens alone!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was continued silence on the part of every
one except the preacher. The congregation knew
the song and loved it, but they acted like they had
never heard either the song or the tune. They
were certainly lacking in that Christian coöperation
which the song recommended, and Vinegar
had to tell his troubles and trials without their
assistance.</p>

<p>Then in utter desperation, Vinegar turned again
to Dinner Gaze and said pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Fer Gawd’s sake, brudder, come out here an’
sing us a sweet toon&mdash;it don’t make difference even
ef we don’t know it.”</p>

<p>Long after Dinner Gaze had ended his brief sojourn
in Tickfall, the congregation of the Shoofly
Church remembered him as he stood before them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
with his scarred face and sang the song of the shining
shore:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“My days are gliding swiftly by,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">An’ I, a pilgrim stranger,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Would not detain ’em as dey fly<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Dem hours of toil an’ danger;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fer, Oh! We stand on Jordon’s strand<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Our frien’s are passin’ over;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">An’ jest befo’, de shinin’ sho’<br /></span>
<span class="i3">We may almost discover.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After this Vinegar arose, announced his text,
and began his sermon.</p>

<p>Thereupon Aunt Biddy Chivill, an old negress,
deaf as an adder, arose from one of the pews and
seated herself in a chair inside the altar railing.
Unrolling a trumpet hose she had inherited at the
death of a wealthy white woman in Tickfall, she
screwed the parts together with great pride and
ostentation, and settled herself to listen.</p>

<p>Vinegar spoke about four sentences to which
Biddy Chivill listened attentively. Then with
an air of final decision, Biddy removed the trumpet
from her ear, unscrewed each part with great care
and stowed the instrument away in a bag which
she carried in her lap, taking great pains to lock the
bag. Folding her hands across her lap she fell
into peaceful slumber while Vinegar Atts bellowed
on.</p>

<p>Sister Ginny Babe Chew, having attempted
two abortive toots upon her trumpet, also fell
asleep.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<p>But while Aunt Biddy Chivill slept, her little
four-year-old granddaughter became immediately
active and very much awake. She crept out into
the aisle and began to walk around aimlessly, her
bare feet making no noise upon the uncarpeted
floor.</p>

<p>For a while she amused herself by staring into
the faces of the men and peeping under the sun-bonnets
of the women. The hands which were
stretched out to arrest her were carefully avoided,
and she rewarded each person making the attempt
with a childish scowl.</p>

<p>Then she sat down upon the floor and crawled
under the benches. She lay on the floor and rolled
under the benches, bobbing up at unexpected
places with an angelic smile.</p>

<p>After this she found a large box in the rear of the
church.</p>

<p>In spite of the town stock laws, the hogs ran wild
in that portion of Tickfall known as Dirty-Six,
where the Shoofly Church was located. Many
of these animals had their sleeping place under the
church, and the building was infested with fleas.</p>

<p>It was a custom when a church meeting was to be
held, to sprinkle the floor with lime and sweep it
out, thus ridding the house temporarily of the
insects. For that purpose a large box of lime was
kept in the rear of the church.</p>

<p>It was this box that the little black baby girl
discovered. She stood on tiptoe, stretched herself
up, and looked in. It was white, very white, inside.
She reached over the edge and touched the whiteness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
She brought the hand out and looked at it.
It also was white.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</p>

<p class="caption">The “Revun” Vinegar Atts began his sermon.</p></div>

<p>Then the child reached into the box with both
hands, filled them with lime, and rubbed them on
her face. By the mercy of heaven, she did not get
any of the stuff into her mouth and eyes. Then
she sat down and rubbed her feet with lime. The
effect was gratifying and she smiled.</p>

<p>By this time the sermon was ended. Vinegar
had not done much, but he had done the best he
could.</p>

<p>“Brudder Tucky Sugg will pray for us!”
Vinegar bawled.</p>

<p>The congregation reverently bowed.</p>

<p>Then a little black girl with lime-whitened face
and hands and legs, trotted silently up the aisle
and stood beside brother Tucky Sugg, listening
earnestly to his bawling voice.</p>

<p>She stretched out a tiny, lime-whitened hand
and touched Tucky Sugg timidly on the top of his
step-ladder head.</p>

<p>“Who you tryin’ to talk to, Revun?” she asked
in a bird-like voice.</p>

<p>Tucky Sugg opened his eyes and saw something
he had never seen before.</p>

<p>With a loud bellow like a frightened cow, he rolled
backward on the floor, and got up with an intense
desire to run.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!”</p>

<p>The voice was like an explosion of dynamite,
and expressed the consternation of the congregation
as they rose to their feet prepared for flight.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>Ginny Babe Chew awoke from her slumber.
She stared at the little child a moment, then
reached out a fat, motherly hand.</p>

<p>“Come here, honey!” she bawled. “Yo’
mammy oughter had washed yo’ face an’ hands
befo’ she sont you to de meetin’-house.”</p>

<p>She wiped the lime off the child with the end of
her apron, and took the child in her lap.</p>

<p>Then, while the congregation was still standing,
Dinner Gaze from his place at one side of the
house began to sing, while all stood and listened:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“At de feast of Bill Shasser an’ a thousan’ of his lords,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While dey drunk from golden vessels as de Book of Truth records,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In de night as dey reveled in de royal palace hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dey wus seized wid cornsternation&mdash;’twas de Hand upon de wall!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So our deeds is recorded&mdash;dar’s a Hand dat’s writin’ now.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sinner, gib yo’ sins de go-by an’ to de Marster bow!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fer de day am approachin’&mdash;it must come to one an’ all<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When de sinner’s corndamnation will git written on de wall!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the instant that the song ended, a long, wailing
cry, that was at once full of anguish and heart-break,
ran through the building!</p>

<p>Old Isaiah Gaitskill, superintendent of the Gaitskill
hog-camp, ran down the aisle, clawing at the
white wool which fitted his head like a rubber cap.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
His face was ashy with the dust of the high-way,
and tears had streaked it where they had ran
downward through the dust.</p>

<p>“My Gawd, cullud folks!” he wailed. “De
white folks is done kotched Hitch Diamond&mdash;dey
are fotchin’ him to jail right now! Here dey come
down de big road. Oh, my Gawd!”</p>

<p>The old negro turned and fell with his hands
clasping the altar, sobbing like a child.</p>

<h3>X<br />

HOME AGAIN.</h3>

<p>The entire congregation ran out of the building
into the churchyard and looked up the street. To
the end of their lives they never forgot what they
saw.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond, bareheaded, barefooted, dressed
in a red undershirt and a pair of blue overalls, was
walking down the middle of the street, his hands
manacled behind him, his head hanging in shame.</p>

<p>Dust covered him from head to feet, and perspiration
streamed down his face. He had tried to
wipe the perspiration away by rubbing his head
upon his broad shoulders, and this had smeared
his face with mud until he was a horrible creature
to behold.</p>

<p>Hitch looked old, he looked sick. All of the
pride and jauntiness which had characterized him
when he left Tickfall for the prize-fight had
dropped away, and he was merely the shell of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
man who had gone away from home to certain
pugilistic victory.</p>

<p>On either side of Hitch Diamond rode a strange
white man&mdash;New Orleans detectives employed by
the mill owners of Sawtown to track the fugitive
down. Behind the three rode the sheriff of Tickfall
Parish, Mr. John Flournoy.</p>

<p>Dainty Blackum ran back into the church and
brought from the pulpit a glass pitcher with a
broken spout. She met Hitch and the officers
right in front of the church, and the officers called
a halt as she held the pitcher up to Hitch Diamond’s
thirsty lips. Then, dipping a handkerchief into
the water, she wiped the mud and sweat from the
tortured man’s face.</p>

<p>Wail after wail arose from the crowd of negroes
in front of the Shoofly Church, and Hitch turned
and looked at them as if he did not realize where
he was.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts ran out and placed his trembling
hand upon Sheriff Flournoy’s dusty stirrup.</p>

<p>“Whut dey got Hitch fer, Marse John?” he
sobbed.</p>

<p>“Murder!” Flournoy growled through jaws
which were shut together like a bear-trap. “He
killed the night watchman at the Sawtown mill!”</p>

<p>The party started again, and Vinegar stood in
his tracks as if turned to stone.</p>

<p>It seemed to take a few minutes for the Shoofly
congregation to comprehend what Flournoy had
said, or else the shock was so great that even their
emotions could find no expression, voluble as they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
are as a race. Then a moan of sorrow swept like
a deep-toned note from some mighty musical
instrument; it was rich, melodious, heart-breaking&mdash;an
expression of the deepest and most acute
grief of their humble lives.</p>

<p>For Hitch was the hero of the colored population
of Tickfall. They had shared his glory as victor
in many a hard-fought fistic battle. They had
won many dollars on his prowess as a boxer. They
had helped to train him and perfect his wonderful
physical organization for every contest he had
ever participated in, and they loved him!</p>

<p>And Hitch deserved their affection. According
to his lights he was a good man, a clean liver, one
who took the best care he knew how of his superb
body. There was nothing vicious or ugly about
his disposition. He was merely a great, strong,
bone-headed pugilist, who had made the most of
himself by developing and using the best talent
he possessed, namely, his giant strength.</p>

<p>Still moaning like the sea as the tide flows out,
the Shoofly congregation flowed out into the road
and fell in behind, forming a long procession of sorrowing
friends.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above the low moan, in a tone which
ripped and roared and snarled like the angry
water breaking through a levee, came the mighty
voice of Ginny Babe Chew:</p>

<p>“Murder! Murder! Murder! Whut do Gawd
Awmighty think about dat?”</p>

<p>She pranced down the street, thrusting the
people aside with her ponderous body as a steamboat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
cuts through the mushy ice upon a river.
Her voice howled like a wolf’s call, with a taunting,
bark-like, malicious, nerve-searing gratification:</p>

<p>“Murder!”</p>

<p>She managed to reach the head of the procession
and walked just behind Sheriff Flournoy’s horse.</p>

<p>She whirled round and round like a Dervish,
stooped and threw dust in the air, tore her clothes,
and waving her fists at the sky shrieked like a
maniac:</p>

<p>“Murder! Murder! Murder!”</p>

<p>John Flournoy stopped his horse, and turned
and looked at her with a queer expression upon his
face. Once he opened his mouth to speak, then
shut his jaws tight, turned his eyes forward and
rode on.</p>

<p>“Murder!” Ginny Babe Chew screamed.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts could endure the horror no longer.
He ran forward, and caught Ginny Babe by her
fat shoulder and whirled her around. Vinegar
had had years of experience as a pugilist and was
Hitch’s boxing partner to this day. He knew
exactly where to place his blow.</p>

<p>His open palm with all his strength behind it
flattened upon Ginny Babe’s squalling lips. She
uttered a low grunt, and fell in the street.</p>

<p>John Flournoy looked back and nodded his
approval.</p>

<p>The crowd coming behind split in two halves,
and walked around Ginny’s prostrate body, noting
without pity that a stream of blood was flowing
from her thick lips. The crowd behind had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
augmented by hundreds before they reached the
Hen-Scratch saloon.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts had just come to town in his
automobile, and was standing in front of his place
of business. His face turned the color of ashes,
and his lips stiffened with horror as he realized
what was coming down the street to meet him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hitch!” he wailed. “Shorely dey ain’t
got you right, is dey, Hitch? Tell me dat dey
done missed it!”</p>

<p>But Hitch was too tortured to reply. He cast
one lingering look upon his friend, and turned
away with blood-shot, agonized eyes. Skeeter
Butts reeled back from the middle of the street and
covered his eyes with his trembling hands.</p>

<p>For a while after that the procession moved forward
in silence. Then a succession of piercing
screams shattered the atmosphere. A handsome
girl, whose hands and face were the color of old
gold, came running down the street, and threw her
arms around Hitch Diamond’s neck.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hitchie! Hitchie! Hitchie!” she screamed.</p>

<p>It was Goldie Curtain, Hitch’s wife.</p>

<p>For a moment Hitch’s giant body wavered, his
knees bent under him, and he staggered as if about
to fall. He stopped and leaned heavily upon the
sobbing girl whose arms clasped his neck.</p>

<p>“Move on!” a sharp-voiced officer spoke.</p>

<p>Goldie Curtain fell in the dust of the street like
one dead. Sheriff Flournoy, whose face was turned
to look behind him, did not see her lying there.
His nervous horse leaped over her prostrate body.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<p>Vinegar Atts, sobbing aloud, picked the girl up
in his powerful arms, carried her into her own
house and placed her upon a bed. Then he came
out and joined again with the crowd which followed
Hitch until the doors of the jail closed behind him.</p>

<p>When Hitch had passed out of sight behind
those doors, Ginny Babe Chew came staggering
down the street, wiping the blood from her lips
and the front of her dress. She stood in the middle
of the street in front of the jail, shrieking like a
maniac. She stooped and gathered handfuls of
sand and tossed them into the air above her head,
while her calliope-like voice shrieked again and
again:</p>

<p>“Good-by, Hitch! Good-by, Hitch! Good-by,
Hitch!”</p>

<h3>XI<br />

UP AGAINST IT.</h3>

<p>A whole week passed during which Skeeter
Butts sat in the Hen-Scratch saloon, nervously
smoking cigarettes and listening to the whispered
tales which came to him from his negro friends.</p>

<p>Skeeter had made no attempt to see Hitch Diamond,
and had not talked about him to any of the
white people. He knew it was not wise to show
too much interest in the case of a negro criminal.
He did not care to get himself under suspicion.
All of Hitch’s friends felt the same way, and since
their first dramatic display of emotion as Hitch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
was led captive before the Shoofly Church, they
had assumed an attitude of indifference toward
Hitch and his pitiable plight.</p>

<p>It was the Sunday following Hitch’s return to
Tickfall when Skeeter determined to interview
Sheriff John Flournoy. Skeeter timed his call with
the sheriff’s custom of sitting on a little side porch
of his home and smoking an after-dinner cigar.</p>

<p>Skeeter fumbled for a few minutes with his hat,
considering how to begin what he had to say.
Then he asked:</p>

<p>“Marse John, whut is de white folks gwine do
wid Hitch Diamond?”</p>

<p>“Hang him!” Flournoy said bluntly, merely for
the purpose of seeing what Skeeter would say next.</p>

<p>The colored man said nothing for five minutes.
He sank down weakly upon the bottom step of the
porch, his shoulders pathetically hunched, and his
head resting upon his hands. At last he mumbled:</p>

<p>“Marse John, I don’t b’lieve Hitch kilt anybody.
He never done it.”</p>

<p>“Have you any proof of his innocence, Skeeter?”
Flournoy asked.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard for me to believe, Skeeter,” Flournoy
continued quietly. “Hitch Diamond was born
on my plantation, and ever since I have known him
he has been a big, good-natured, bone-headed,
peaceable, law-abiding negro. Robbery and murder
are not in his line.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, Marse John&mdash;Hitch never done
it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span></p>

<p>There was a little silence, after which Flournoy
said:</p>

<p>“I think they’ve got Hitch, Skeeter. Some of
the white people in this town have always been
very fond of Hitch. They ought to come to his
aid at once&mdash;he’s their nigger. But all the white
folks have kept away.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a bad sign, Marse John,” Skeeter agreed
mournfully.</p>

<p>“Yes. It means that Hitch is up against it.”</p>

<p>“Whut proofs is dey got, Marse John?” Skeeter
asked.</p>

<p>Replying, Flournoy spoke slowly and painfully,
as if the narration was repugnant to him:</p>

<p>“Hitch Diamond got off the train at Sawtown
about three o’clock on Monday afternoon. A
grocer saw him dressed in a stove-pipe hat, a
Prince Albert coat, and a yellow waistcoat. A
little later he was seen by two small white boys
without his hat, coat, or vest, sitting on the wharf-boat.
A watchman on the wharf-boat says that
Hitch attempted to run when he came near, and in
the effort to arrest Hitch his shirt was torn off his
back. Dainty Blackum says that Hitch came to
her home, barefooted, bareheaded, with no outer
shirt, but wearing a red undershirt.</p>

<p>“Hitch Diamond and Dude Blackum had a
drink together, and then both men left Blackum’s
cabin about dark and went toward the sawmill.
Five hours later the commissary store was robbed
and the watchman was killed.</p>

<p>“The mill employees organized a search-party
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
and had a hand to hand battle with Hitch Diamond
inside the lumber yard, and Hitch escaped.
The flash-lights were playing on Hitch, and everybody
saw him and recognized him.</p>

<p>“After Hitch escaped, Dude Blackum was
caught inside the lumber yard, and in attempting
to escape by swimming the Mississippi River,
Dude was drowned.”</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” Skeeter shuddered.</p>

<p>“Now, here is the worst part of it,” Flournoy
continued. “A stove-pipe hat, a Prince Albert
coat, and a yellow waistcoat were found under
the steps of the commissary store, and these garments
fit Hitch Diamond perfectly, and Hitch
admits that they are his. A pair of black trousers,
torn at the seat and with one leg split up the front
from the bottom almost to the waistband, was
found near the scene of the fight in the lumber
yard, and this pair of trousers fits Hitch and he
admits that the garment is his.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lawdy!” Skeeter shuddered.</p>

<p>“Hitch can give no reason for his visit to Sawtown
except that he had never been there and
wanted to see the place. He explains the loss of
his hat and coat and vest by saying that he surrendered
them to a negro whom he had never
seen before and whose name he did not know to
be hung up in the Sawtown barracks where the
homeless workmen sleep. He confesses that he
abandoned his trousers in the lumber yard for the
purpose of fighting his way through the mob of
searchers and escaping.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span></p>

<p>“Hitch declares that he did not know a human
being in Sawtown. Dainty Blackum says that
Hitch told her that he had known Dude Blackum
for many years. Hitch says he went to Dude
Blackum’s cabin to get a drink of liquor. Dainty
says he pretended to be a negro preacher, and
claimed to be much hurt because Dude had not
secured him to marry them.</p>

<p>“Hitch admits that he traveled from Sawtown
to the Gaitskill hog-camp wearing no garments
except his underclothes, and going by night. Old
Isaiah Gaitskill says that Hitch came to his cabin
in that undressed condition, sick with hunger and
exhaustion, and would not permit him to send for a
doctor, to inform his wife, or let any of his friends
know where he was!”</p>

<p>“My lawdymussy!” Skeeter chattered. The
little barkeeper felt as though cold snakes were
crawling up and down his spine, and he sat for ten
minutes without saying a word. At last Flournoy
asked:</p>

<p>“What do you make of it, Skeeter?”</p>

<p>“Marse John,” Skeeter protested in a wailing
tone, “Hitch Diamond is done cornfessed too
much!”</p>

<p>Flournoy understood exactly what he meant.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he said. “Hitch has talked too
freely to be guilty&mdash;his statements have been
too frank. A guilty negro never does that; if
he commits a crime, he denies everything to
the very last, and offers no explanation for anything.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Skeeter sighed. “Dat’s how he
do.”</p>

<p>“But you’d have a happy time convincing a
jury of Hitch’s innocence on the ground that he
had talked too much!”</p>

<p>After a long silence, Skeeter asked:</p>

<p>“Whut does you think about dis case, Marse
John?”</p>

<p>“I think Hitch was drunk,” Flournoy answered.
“I doubt if Hitch himself knows whether he
committed that crime or not. He talks a lot of
stuff about meeting a man on the train, about
losing some money, about giving his clothes away,
about being stepped on by some man while he was
lying asleep in a gulley&mdash;all of it a perfect mess.
I hate to admit it, but I really believe that Hitch
committed the crime while in an intoxicated
condition. Dainty Blackum says that he took
fourteen swallows of bust-head, pine-top, nigger
whisky in her cabin, and that he and Dude took
the jug with them when they left.”</p>

<p>“My gosh!” Skeeter sighed. “When did de
white folks ’terrogate Dainty Blackum?”</p>

<p>“They questioned her in Sawtown the day after
Dude was killed by the mob,” Flournoy replied.
“Dainty is here now&mdash;in Ginny Babe Chew’s
house. I’m keeping watch on her, because she’s a
material witness.”</p>

<p>“When am Hitch’s trial gwine be, Marse John?”
Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>“It begins a month from next Tuesday,” the
sheriff said.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p>

<p>“Pore old Hitchy!” Skeeter mourned.</p>

<p>Two big tears rolled down his cheeks and
dropped upon his brown hands. His lips began to
tremble, and he hid his face with his hat and sat
with his shoulders shaking with grief. Finally he
said in a mournful voice:</p>

<p>“Hitch is always been de bes’ nigger frien’ I’m
had, Marse John&mdash;him an’ Vinegar Atts. I wus
always a little runt nigger an’ I didn’t had no
kinnery, an’ Hitch an’ Vinegar, dey always deefended
me when de yuther nigger-boys pecked on
me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Skeeter began to sob and sat mourning for his
friend as though he were already dead.</p>

<p>Flournoy endured the racket as long as he cared
to, then tossed his cigar-stub into a rose-bush,
walked down the steps, and climbed into his
automobile.</p>

<p>Without a word to Skeeter, he shot down the
runway into the street and turned toward the
courthouse. In a moment he was swallowed up
in a cloud of dust.</p>

<h3>XII<br />

HITCH’S MOTHER.</h3>

<p>Skeeter sat for two hours turning over the
appalling array of facts which the sheriff had set
before him for the condemnation of his friend.
Nothing seemed to be lacking except Hitch’s
confession that he had robbed the store and killed
the watchman.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<p>“Dis here is awful!” he sighed. “I’s gwine
over an’ git some religium advices from de Revun
Vinegar Atts.”</p>

<p>He found Vinegar occupying his customary seat
under a chinaberry tree in front of the Shoofly
Church. Vinegar moved his chair only when the
shadow of the tree shifted and the sun shone upon
his head. He called this diversion “settin’ de sun
aroun’ de tree.”</p>

<p>“Revun,” Skeeter began, “I been cornversin’
Marse John Flournoy about our chu’ch an’ lodge
brudder, Hitch Diamond.”</p>

<p>“No hope!” Vinegar grumbled. “Hitch is
done flirted wid a hearse one time too many. He’s
as good as dead.”</p>

<p>“Cain’t we do nothin’ fer him?” Skeeter
asked.</p>

<p>“We kin save up money in de chu’ch an’ de
lodge fer a real nice funeral,” Vinegar said. “Atter
de white folks is done deir wuck, Hitch’ll furnish
de corp’.”</p>

<p>“Is you interrogated any of de white folks?”
Skeeter inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. Marse Tom Gaitskill tole me all I
knows. Hitch wucked fer de kunnel, an’ kunnel
say he’s got to git him anodder nigger&mdash;de cote-house
is gwine spile Hitch!”</p>

<p>“Ain’t de kunnel tryin’ to he’p Hitch none?”
Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>“Naw. What kin be did fer a nigger whut is
kotch his tail in a cuttin’-box like Hitch done?”</p>

<p>“I feels sorry fer Hitch, Revun,” Skeeter mumbled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
piteously. “Gawd, I’d do anything fer him
dat I could!”</p>

<p>“Not me!” Vinegar bellowed. “When de white
folks backs off, dat’s de sign fer Revun Atts to git
away befo’ de bust-up comes. Naw, suh, Hitch
ain’t got no hope!”</p>

<p>Vinegar’s voice was a bellow which could be
heard a block away. He stood up, took off his
stove-pipe preaching hat, and mopped the sweat
from the top of his bald head with a big, red
handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh!” he howled. “You oughter had
been to chu’ch dis mawnin’ an’ heered me orate
’bout Hitch Diamond. I shore preached his
funeral good! I tole dem niggers how Hitch
went to N’Awleens an’ fit in a sinful prize-fight an’
got on a big, bust-head drunk an’ vamoosed up to
Sawtown an’ robbed an’ kilt, an’ is fotch back here
now to dis town to show whut happens to de
members of de Shoo-fly Chu’ch when dey rambles
away from de highways of holiness&mdash;whoosh!”</p>

<p>Vinegar broke off with a snort and a flourish,
seizing the chair in which he had sat and thrust
it up so close to Skeeter’s chair that he pinched
Skeeter’s fingers.</p>

<p>Then he sat down with his thick lips not two
inches from Skeeter’s ear.</p>

<p>“Listen, Skeeter,” he whispered. “Marse Tom
Gaitskill an’ Sheriff John Flournoy don’t think
dat Hitch is guilty&mdash;dey’s bellerin’ it aroun’
town that Hitch is shore a deader so dey kin hunt
fer de real guilty man on de sly!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span></p>

<p>“Bless Gawd!” Skeeter grinned.</p>

<p>“I been buttlin’ fer Marse Tom ever since
Hitch went to N’Awleens, an’ I been snoopin’
aroun’ an’ listenin’ to deir talk. Marse Tom an’
Marse John sot up mighty nigh all night las’
Friday talkin’ an’ smokin’ an’ cussin’ in Marse
Tom’s dinin’-room. I sot up out on de porch an’
listened to ’em. Dey done agree dat de bes’ thing
fer Hitch is fer eve’ybody not to hab no hope. I
agrees wid de white folks.”</p>

<p>“Bless Gawd!” Skeeter Butts cackled.</p>

<p>“Git yo’ nose on de trail an’ sot yo’ mouth to
howlin’ like a houn’-dog, Skeeter,” Vinegar
grinned. Then, in a bellow which echoed back
from the woods in the rear of the church, he howled:
“No hope!”</p>

<p>“Dem is de best religium advices you ever
orated, Revun,” Skeeter cackled as he rose to his
feet. “I’s gwine turn detecative right dis minute
an’ snoop aroun’ seein’ how much I kin find out!”</p>

<p>He walked straight to the courthouse and
entered the sheriff’s office.</p>

<p>“Could I be allowed to see Hitch, Marse John?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Any of his colored friends may see
him if they come at a reasonable time. I’ll admit
you to the jail.”</p>

<p>When Skeeter was admitted and locked behind
the bars of the jail, and saw Hitch Diamond
pacing up and down the corridor in the second
story, the only occupant of the prison, he found
to his annoyance that he could not begin a word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
of conversation with his lifelong friend. When
talking to others, he could speak about Hitch
and his misfortune with great volubility, but face
to face with Hitch, what was there to say?</p>

<p>The two sat down, Skeeter laid a package of
cigarettes upon the seat of a chair beside them,
and after that for twenty minutes there was perfect
silence. Not a word had been spoken except
their first brief and embarrassed greetings. Each
sat, smoking furiously, and lighting a fresh cigarette
upon the stub of the old one.</p>

<p>At last Skeeter managed to speak, and made
the one request which opened the floodgates of
Hitch Diamond’s talk:</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it, Hitchy. Don’t leave out
no little thing.”</p>

<p>Hitch dropped his cigarette at his feet and began.</p>

<p>For two hours his low voice rumbled on, the
narrative beginning from the moment he left Tickfall
to go to New Orleans to the prize-fight and
progressing with minute particularity to the
moment when he sat in the jail beside Skeeter
Butts.</p>

<p>Skeeter listened with a heart as heavy as lead.
It seemed to him that Hitch had confessed everything
except the actual commission of the crime of
murder and robbery. The array of proof which
Flournoy had was sustained and established in
every particular by Hitch’s story. Vinegar had
fired his hopes for a moment by betraying the
secret that the white folks were unconvinced of
Hitch’s guilt and were hunting for the perpetrator
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
of the deed. But Skeeter knew when Hitch had
finished his story that Hitch would pay the penalty
for his crime.</p>

<p>Not a word did Skeeter utter until the narrative
was ended. Then he arose and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Hitch,” he said, with a catch in his
voice. He walked down the steps, and the jailer
opened the door and let him out.</p>

<p>Passing across the courthouse yard he met
Sheriff Flournoy.</p>

<p>“Marse John,” he said, “you tole me dat Hitch
wus borned on yo’ plantation. Does you know
who his maw is?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Is his maw livin’ yit?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t never heerd Hitch say nothin’ ’bout his
maw,” Skeeter remarked.</p>

<p>“Hitch don’t know who his mother is,” Flournoy
smiled. “I doubt if she knows that Hitch is
her son.”</p>

<p>“How come?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>“Hitch’s mother committed a little crime the
year before I was elected sheriff. Hitch was then
one year old. His mother abandoned him&mdash;ran
off and stayed away for thirty years. Hitch was
taken care of by the other negroes on the plantation,
and all who once knew who Hitch’s mother
is are now either dead or have gone away from
here.”</p>

<p>“Fer Gawd’s sake, Marse John!” Skeeter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
wailed. “Why don’t you tell Hitch who his maw
am? Who is she?”</p>

<p>Flournoy considered this question while he took
the time to light a fresh cigar. Then he asked:</p>

<p>“If I tell you who Hitch’s mother is, will you
promise never to reveal it?”</p>

<p>“I promises!” Skeeter exclaimed.</p>

<p>“His mother is Ginny Babe Chew!” the sheriff
told him.</p>

<p>Skeeter reeled back from the shock, and an
exclamation shot from his throat like a bullet.</p>

<p>He turned round and round like a man who was
dazed, uttering a series of highly profane expletives
like the crackling of thorns under a pot.</p>

<p>“You asked me why I didn’t tell Hitch who his
mother was,” the sheriff continued, as he started
away. “I think you know the answer!”</p>

<p>Ginny Babe Chew!</p>

<p>Like a panorama the events of the Sunday before
passed before his dazed and horrified vision&mdash;Ginny
Babe Chew, shrieking, cursing, whooping,
thrusting the people aside and pressing up
behind the sheriff’s horse, howling after her son the
charge of “Murder! Murder! Murder!” Again
he saw her struck down by the massive fist of Vinegar
Atts, the blood streaming from her lips, the
mob splitting into halves as they walked past her,
while she groaned and cursed, groveling in the dust.
Again he saw her staggering down the street, the
blood reddening the front of her dress and making
a red froth upon her lips, as she stood in front of
the jail tossing dust into the air, gyrating, shrieking,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
cursing, and wailing, “Good-by, Hitch!
Good-by, Hitch!”</p>

<p>What a mother for any man to have!</p>

<p>Skeeter staggered across the courthouse yard,
wiping the clammy sweat from his temples.</p>

<p>“Marse John made me promise not to tell
nobody who Hitch’s maw is. Ef I wus to tell dat
fack, de white folks would hang Hitch Diamond
befo’ night. Dat’s de awfullest fack agin him
yit!”</p>

<p>In front of the post-office he met Vinegar Atts.</p>

<p>“Revun Atts,” Skeeter said earnestly, “ef you
know any good religium advices to gib to a nigger
whut is about to die, fer de Lawd sake go preach
’em to Hitch Diamond. De white folks is got
him&mdash;got him good!”</p>

THE HOODOO FACE.</h3>

<p>The sunshine lay hot upon the sand in the
negro settlement called Dirty-Six when Dainty
Blackum arose from her bed, dressed, and walked
out into the yard. In the rear of Ginny Babe
Chew’s house was a large number of fig and pecan-trees,
and under the shade of one of these trees,
patiently waiting and smoking a cigarette, was
Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p>For a moment Dainty was surprised; then she
reflected that she had expected some man to be
there that morning, as some man had been there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
every morning, and she would have been disappointed
if she had not found one.</p>

<p>But Skeeter Butts had never been there before.
She had heard that he was very susceptible to the
charms of women, but up to this time she had
received the devoted attention of only two men&mdash;Dinner
Gaze and Tucky Sugg.</p>

<p>She came over and sat down beside Skeeter.</p>

<p>“Yistiddy wus a busy day fer me, Skeeter,”
she began. “Two men tole me dey loved me an’
axed me to marry ’em. Dat’s a pretty good
starter.”</p>

<p>Skeeter had entertained no idea of making love
to Dainty when he called to see her, having had an
entirely different purpose. But as he did not know
exactly how to approach the subject which he
wished to discuss, he decided to follow her line of
conversation, hoping to direct it at a later time.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, dat’s so,” Skeeter remarked without
enthusiasm. “De fack is, I wus so busy dat I
looked over de chance to ax you to marry me
yistiddy, so I comed early dis mawnin’ to git in a
word ’bout dat&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I tole de two yuther men dey wus losin’ time,
an’ I tells you dat same word in eggsvance.”</p>

<p>“Of co’se, I don’t expeck you to fall right in wid
dat suggestion,” Skeeter hastened to say. “But
I wants you to know whut way I is leanin’.”</p>

<p>“You done took a notion to lean mighty sudden,”
Dainty snapped. “You better lean de
yuther way. You ain’t able to suppote no wife.”</p>

<p>“Whut’s de use of gittin’ able to suppote somepin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
you ain’t got?” Skeeter asked absently. “Us
owns a hoss befo’ us buys any hoss-feed.”</p>

<p>The girl made no reply.</p>

<p>After a while Skeeter added another remark in
an absent-minded way:</p>

<p>“Sometimes niggers buys a hoss an’ depen’s on
stealin’ de hoss-feed. Dey always gits in trouble
wid de white folks, too, when dey does dat.”</p>

<p>Instantly the girl’s manner changed completely.
She bit her lips and her hands began to tremble.
She looked as if dizziness and weakness were about
to overcome her.</p>

<p>“When a nigger gits in trouble wid de white
folks, it’s all off wid him,” Skeeter blundered on,
his mind upon Hitch Diamond, and all unconscious
of the impression he was making upon the girl
beside him. “Sometimes luck is wid him an’ he
kin run off, but most often he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Suddenly Skeeter broke off and looked at Dainty
with popping eyes. For the moment he had forgotten
the tragedy in the girl’s life, and now he
was struck speechless, and merely sat there and
stared and gasped. At last he murmured:</p>

<p>“I done slopped de wrong pig!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, Skeeter,” the girl said in a bitter
tone. “De best thing you kin do is to ramble
outen dis yard an’ don’t come back no more.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean nothin’, Dainty,” Skeeter said
humbly. “I’s done had a heap of trouble, an’ it
’pears like I ain’t got my real good sense.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a fack,” Dainty said.</p>

<p>“I won’t never do it no mo’,” Skeeter pleaded.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

<p>“Dat’s a fack,” Dainty announced. She arose
and walked into the house.</p>

<p>Skeeter remained seated upon the bench, trying
to think up some way to square himself with the
girl, but his mind would not work with its usual
facility.</p>

<p>Then in the yard on the other side of the house
there was a loud, angry squall, followed by the
wild, frightened squawking of a hen, and Ginny
Babe Chew waddled around to where Skeeter
was sitting.</p>

<p>At the corner of the house there was a barrel
of rain-water setting under a gutter-spout, and
into this water Ginny Babe ducked the hen viciously
a number of times.</p>

<p>She tossed the hen on the ground, where it lay
gasping for air and half drowned.</p>

<p>Skeeter sat and cackled like another hen.</p>

<p>“Shut up, you little devil!” Ginny Babe
squalled. “I’ll ketch you an’ do you de same
way!”</p>

<p>“Whut ails de hen, Ginny?” Skeeter laughed.</p>

<p>“She wants to sot, an’ I ain’t got no eggs to put
under her,” Ginny whooped. “I locked her up
in de wood-house an’ she foun’ a ole china door-knob
an’ sot on dat. I put her in de corn-crib an’
she sot down on a lot of corn-cobs an’ tried to hatch
’em out. I’s ducked her in dat barrel of water
’bout fo’teen times, an’ it ain’t done no good
whatsumever. I never <i>did</i> see such a fool!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you try on somepin else?” Skeeter
giggled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span></p>

<p>“Whut’s dat?” Ginny whooped.</p>

<p>“Pour a leetle coal-ile on her tail an’ sot it on
fire,” Skeeter snickered. “I figger she won’t sot
no more atter dat.”</p>

<p>“By gosh, I’ll do it!” Ginny Babe howled.</p>

<p>She walked over and pushed the hen with her
foot.</p>

<p>“You don’t git no coal-ile on yo’ tail yit!” she
bellowed. “But as soon as dem feathers gits dry,
I got a good mind to try it!”</p>

<p>Skeeter looked at Ginny Babe Chew, and a cold
chill ran down his spine. She was the one woman
in Tickfall of whom every negro was afraid. She
was a wicked, vicious, horrible old woman, whose
little, green pig eyes glowed poisonously through
the rolls of facial flesh. She possessed an ugly and
venomous laugh, and generally ended her profane
and vicious remarks with an irritating chuckle.</p>

<p>Ginny knew the history of all the people in Tickfall
parish, both white and black, and most of her
conversation on ordinary occasions was a discussion
of their characters. She especially loved to
drive nails in the coffins of moribund reputations.</p>

<p>Now she sat down heavily and began a conversation
upon her favorite theme.</p>

<p>“I done wucked in de house of eve’y white man
in dis parish whut is able to hire he’p,” she bawled.
“I knows all de fambly secrets, an’ I done got my
little, bullet eye on all de fambly skelingtons. I’s
made acquaintance wid all de niggers in dis parish,
too, an’ I tells you dis&mdash;some niggers is bad, an’
yuther niggers is wusser; but dar ain’t no good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
niggers, livin’ or dead! I knows ’em! So I spends
my happy old age findin’ out all de bad I kin about
’em!”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Skeeter gasped, looking at her with
frightened eyes.</p>

<p>“All you niggers in Tickfall&mdash;whoof!” the old
woman exploded.</p>

<p>“I hopes we is as good as most niggers,” Skeeter
said timidly.</p>

<p>“Whoof!” the old woman exploded again.
“Does you want me to tell you whut I knows
about <i>you</i>, Skeeter Butts?”</p>

<p>“Fer Gawd’s sake, no’m!” Skeeter quavered.
“My memory is powerful good.”</p>

<p>The woman’s fat body shook with silent laughter
and her little pig eyes glowed like emeralds. She
laid a heavy, fat hand on Skeeter’s knee.</p>

<p>“I’s got a hoodoo face, Skeeter!” she bawled.
“When a nigger looks at my fat mug, all de meanness
in him comes right out on his face so I kin
read it like de white folks reads a book. Yes, suh,
I got a hoodoo face!”</p>

<p>While Skeeter Butts sat beside her and trembled,
wondering what to say, and very much wishing
himself somewhere else, Dinner Gaze and Tucky
Sugg came around to the side of the house where
they were sitting.</p>

<p>“You want me to cornfess yo’ sins fer you,
Dinner Gaze?” Ginny Babe howled, turning her
green eyes upon him.</p>

<p>“You don’t know nothin’.” Dinner asserted,
gazing at her with his beady eyes without a trace
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
of fear, his black, dough-like face as expressionless
as when Hitch Diamond had first seen it.</p>

<p>“Whoof!” the old woman exploded the third
time. Shifting her mountainous fat to her feet
and standing up, she glared at Dinner Gaze in a
perfect fury; then, to Skeeter’s surprise, her voice
changed completely from its bellowing tone to an
intonation as soft as Dinner’s own. She muttered
aloud, looking at Dinner with intent gaze as if she
were seeing him for the first time:</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, I don’t know nothin’ agin you!”</p>

<p>“I gambles fer a livin’,” Dinner grinned. “Dat
ain’t no highbrow job. I follers de races an’ hangs
aroun’ prize-fighters, an’ drinks a little booze an’
plays a little craps an’ coon-can, but I ain’t got
nothin’ to hide from nobody.”</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Ginny whooped in a triumphant
voice. “Didn’t I jes’ tole you dat I had a hoodoo
face? Nobody kin look at me an’ hide deir sins!”</p>

<p>“I ain’t allowin’ nobody to low-rate me,
neither,” Tucky Sugg proclaimed. “You wanter
cornfess my sins, Sister Ginny?”</p>

<p>Ginny broke out into a loud, whooping laugh.
“You ain’t got no sins, Tucky,” she guffawed.
“You ain’t nothin’ but a idjut&mdash;an’ no limb didn’t
fall on you, neither. You was nachel-bawned dat
way. Idjuts ain’t responsible!”</p>

<p>Chuckling to herself, she picked up her fast-reviving
hen, carried it back to a large hen-house
on the other side of her home, and threw it inside
the door. Closing the door she waddled back, and
waved a fat hand at the three men. “Don’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
fergit dat Ginny’s got a hoodoo face, niggers!”
she bawled.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Dinner Gaze grunted. “Listen to dat
ole fat fool!”</p>

<p>“Come on, niggers,” Tucky Sugg said in a disgusted
tone. “Less git away from dis place.”</p>

<p>As the three men walked down the street,
Skeeter said: “Dinner, is you ever had any expe’unce
’tendin’ bar?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh.”</p>

<p>“Would you wish to he’p Pap Curtain take keer
of my saloom fer de nex’ ten days?” he asked
next.</p>

<p>“It’ll suit me fine,” Dinner told him.</p>

<p>They discussed the business for a little while,
then Skeeter left them at the next corner.</p>

<p>“I leaves it wid you an’ Pap, Dinner,” Skeeter
said. “I needs a leetle rest an’ I’s gwine to trabbel
some.”</p>

<h3>XIV<br />

SKEETER STARTS A BLAZE.</h3>

<p>For the next four days Pap Curtain and Dinner
Gaze tended bar in the Hen-Scratch saloon for
Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts and Tucky Sugg started a protracted
meeting in the old Shoofly Church which
was attended by throngs who listened with bated
breath to Vinegar’s bawling exhortations to righteousness
based upon the horrible example of Hitch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
Diamond, who found himself in a predicament
where there was “no hope.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Skeeter went to New Orleans, and
to Sawtown. He tracked Hitch Diamond from
the moment he left Tickfall to go to the prize-fight
until he returned to Tickfall, bareheaded,
barefooted, with his hands manacled behind him,
and under the escort of the officers of the law.</p>

<p>In both places he dodged Sheriff John Flournoy,
who was also conducting an investigation. Both
were on the same mission, and Skeeter saw Flournoy
a dozen times at different places.</p>

<p>Skeeter and Flournoy returned to Tickfall,
crushed and hopeless, appalled at the array of
evidence which Hitch Diamond had to confront
at his coming trial. It was not a pretense, but a
fact, that Hitch Diamond had no hope.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when Skeeter climbed
wearily off the train at Tickfall and started up the
street toward Dirty-Six. He overtook Sheriff
John Flournoy walking slowly up the street.</p>

<p>“Whut is Hitch’s chances now, Marse John?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“He has none,” Flournoy replied. “There is
no longer a shadow of doubt in my mind that Hitch
Diamond committed the crime with which he is
charged.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s de way it looks,” Skeeter agreed
sadly. He dropped behind, stopped, and let the
sheriff go on alone. He stood leaning against a
fence for a while, wondering what to do next.
Finally he said to himself:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span></p>

<p>“I’s gwine to Ginny Babe Chew’s cabin an’
narrate her all I is found out. Mebbe dat ole
hoodoo face kin see mo’ hope dan I kin.”</p>

<p>He passed the Hen-Scratch saloon and peeped
into the window, where he saw Pap and Dinner
Gaze playing cards at a small table. He passed
the Shoofly Church, where he heard the voice of
Vinegar Atts bellowing like a lost cow. On the
edge of the settlement he entered the yard of
Ginny Babe Chew’s home, and found Dainty
sitting alone upon the porch.</p>

<p>Ginny Babe was in the hen-house rendering
profane ministrations to the same old hen which
was still of a mind to brood, whether there was
anything to hatch or not.</p>

<p>That hen had entertained Ginny Babe for a
week. She had exhausted every known method to
break up the fowl’s desire to “set,” dousing it in
water, ducking it in ashes, tying a long red trailer
of wool to its feet, and other things of that general
nature. Now she stood growling profanity, wondering
what else she could do to the obstinate old
biddy.</p>

<p>Suddenly she thought of the suggestion made by
Skeeter Butts: “Pour coal-ile on her tail an’ sot
her on fire!”</p>

<p>She picked up an old rag lying in the yard,
wrapped it around the squawking hen’s tail, carried
the fowl to the back porch, where she found
an oil-can, and saturated the rag well with the
petroleum.</p>

<p>Then she struck a match and set the rag afire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span></p>

<p>The startled hen fluttered out of her arms, ran
straight into the hen-house, shed the oil-soaked,
blazing rag with most of her tail feathers, and ran
out of the hen-house into the high weeds.</p>

<p>But the burning rag left in the hen-house got
busy with the loose straw and the other dry
trash, and in a moment the whole house was in a
blaze!</p>

<p>Ginny was famous for the noise she could make
with her throat. Her very name was a perversion
of the word for that noisy hen the guinea, and
from her earliest childhood this word had been
indicative of her chief faculty. But on this occasion
she broke all previous records for racket.</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire! Fire!” she began.</p>

<p>What she said after that and the noises she
made cannot enter into this narrative because
they cannot be reproduced in print.</p>

<p>The dry grass, the straw, the inflammable
trash, the dusty accumulations of years, due to
Ginny’s idea that the way to clean up her yard
was to sweep everything inside the hen-house&mdash;all
was afire and blazing merrily.</p>

<p>Skeeter and Dainty heard her wails and ran
around the house. Then Skeeter grabbed a tree
with both hands, spread his alligator mouth to its
utmost limit, and laughed himself into hysterics.</p>

<p>The portion of Tickfall occupied by the whites
had water-works, and adequate fire protection.
The negro settlement known as Dirty-Six had no
water, but was protected from fire by a chemical
engine. There was a fire-engine house, a pole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
beside it with a bell on top, and a rope suspended
from the bell within reach of the hand.</p>

<p>When the engine-house was first erected four
years before, the negroes had waited rather impatiently
for some one’s house to catch on fire.
They wanted to see their new engine in operation.
Nothing caught fire, not even a chicken-coop.
For four years the bell at the engine-house had not
been rung.</p>

<p>Then, on some occasion which called for a celebration
on the part of the negroes, they had asked
and had been given permission to take the chemical
wagon out, attach the hose, and sprinkle the
street, merely to show that the hose would actually
squirt water and the engine pump it.</p>

<p>After the celebration the apparatus was dragged
back and placed in the engine-house, and the
inhabitants of Dirty-Six resumed their watchful
waiting.</p>

<p>Now the cry of “Fire!” echoed through the
settlement.</p>

<p>It was caught up on every corner. Negroes
seized their shotguns and pistols and ran down
the street, firing them into the air&mdash;the fire-signal
in all Southern villages.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts, standing in the pulpit of the
Shoofly Church, paused in the midst of a fiery
exhortation, listened to the cry of “Fire!” ringing
through the settlement.</p>

<p>“Fire!” Vinegar bellowed, and started in a
lope for the street, leading all the congregation in
the race. They, with the other inhabitants of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
Dirty-Six, gladly assembled, not at the scene of the
fire, but at the engine-house!</p>

<p>“Ring de bell!” a hundred voices bawled.</p>

<p>The bell-rope was gone. Some little piccaninny
had needed a rope to tie his dog and had helped
himself.</p>

<p>Two or three boys tried to climb the post and
ring the bell, but they could not reach it.</p>

<p>“Open de door an’ fotch out de engyne!” the
crowd whooped.</p>

<p>Forty men ran their hands into their pockets
and brought them out empty. They did not have
the key to the door. They had never had the key.
The action was mechanical and unconscious.</p>

<p>Who had the key? No one knew. It had been
two years since any one had entered the building.
The door was locked and the key was lost.</p>

<p>“Bust de door down!” was the next call from
the crowd.</p>

<p>Strong shoulders were pressed against the
fragile door, and the crash of its timbers was
answered by the shouts of the people and the onrush
of the crowd. They laid hold upon the rope
and pulled the machine to the scene of the fire.</p>

<p>Down the alley by the side of the house they
ran, broke down the fence and pulled the machine
into the yard. With many shouts they unwound
the hose, attached it to the engine, turned the
faucets and began to pump.</p>

<p>From the hose came a long whistling sound of
air:</p>

<p>“Whee-ee-ee-e!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span></p>

<p>Not a drop of chemical water. The celebration
two years before had exhausted the chemical, and
the engine had never been recharged. The hen-house
burned without interruption.</p>

<p>Ginny Babe Chew turned toward that crowd of
heroic negro firemen, and the pumps of her profanity
worked without a hitch as she poured out a
stream of sulphurous and vitriolic language upon
their luckless heads. Skeeter Butts still hung
to the tree with both hands, laughing with whoops
like a yelling Comanche.</p>

<p>The firemen laid hold upon their chemical machine
and dragged it out of the yard.</p>

<p>Suddenly Skeeter’s laughter ended with a gurgle
of choked surprise. With his mouth still open
wide, he gazed upward at a little dormer window
which looked out of the attic of Ginny Babe Chew’s
home. Slowly his hair rose up on his head, and
cold chills ran down his spine.</p>

<p>The light reflected from the burning hen-house
clearly revealed a male human face at the dormer
window!</p>

<p>The man was looking down into the yard, watching
the crowd, watching the fire, and at times
grinning at something he saw. Skeeter watched
that face for two or three minutes; its clear outlines
were stamped indelibly upon his mind. He
had never seen the negro before!</p>

<p>Then he sprang to the side of Vinegar Atts and
squalled:</p>

<p>“Come on up-stairs wid me, Vinegar&mdash;quick!”</p>

<p>The two ran into the house. Skeeter took his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
automatic pistol from his pocket, and leading the
way, ran up the little, narrow stairs which led to
the attic. They pushed open the door of the
room and entered.</p>

<p>The room was empty!</p>

<p>Skeeter ran to the window and looked out, just
as he had seen the strange negro do. Instantly the
fat face of Ginny Babe Chew was raised to the
window, her green pig eyes glowed malevolently,
and her fat fists were clenched and raised in malediction.</p>

<p>“Come out of dat attic, you little yellow-faced
debbil!” she whooped. “I’ll bust yo’ neck!”</p>

<h3>XV<br />

COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENSE.</h3>

<p>On the first Tuesday in September the open
spaces in front and on the sides of the Tickfall courthouse
filled up early with a crowd of negroes. It
was the occasion of the opening of the criminal
term of the district court, and all witnesses and
talesmen were called to court for the trial of Hitch
Diamond, charged with murder, against the peace
and dignity of the commonwealth of Louisiana
and the statutes made and provided.</p>

<p>The witnesses and talesmen already sat in the
court-room, along with as many other people,
mostly colored, as could squeeze in there. Even
now, at nine o’clock in the morning, the heat of
that ill-ventilated room was stifling, the odor was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
overpowering. Men sat on the bench seats, on the
back of the benches, on the ledges of the windows;
they stood in the aisles, in the corridors, on the
stairways, and were ranged in rows along the soiled
and dusty walls.</p>

<p>Inside the low railing which divided the room,
and nearest to the chairs which the jurors were to
occupy, Hitch Diamond sat at a long table with
Goldie Curtain by his side. In that crowd of
people, either white or black, Goldie was the one
splotch of vivid coloring&mdash;her face and hands and
neck a beautiful orange in color, and her half-caste
beauty most striking and attractive. Hitch sat
beside the table as stolid and indifferent as a
wooden man, but Goldie trembled, her nervous
fingers plaited in and out of each other like squirming
snakes; she was scared and shrinking, pitiable
and lonely.</p>

<p>Just outside the low railing sat Ginny Babe
Chew and Dinner Gaze, directly behind the broad
back of Hitch Diamond. Ginny slowly slapped
at her fat face with a turkey-wing fan. Her big
mouth was clamped shut like a steel trap, and her
little green, greedy, pig eyes glared through the
rolls of facial fat with baleful, condemning gaze
upon everything and everybody around her.</p>

<p>A little farther away from Hitch, but on the
same front seat with Ginny Chew and Dinner
Gaze, sat the Reverend Vinegar Atts and Tucky
Sugg.</p>

<p>There was a window behind the jury-box, so
that the light falling over the heads of the jurors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
would fall full upon the faces of the witnesses as
they sat in the chair, and would illumine every line
in the faces of the lawyers as they presented their
sides to the jury.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the room there was
another window, and within this window, sitting
precariously on the ledge, was Pap Curtain. He
had asked and obtained permission from Sheriff
Flournoy to sit within the bar on the ground that
it was his son-in-law who was being tried for his
life.</p>

<p>Across from Hitch Diamond the district attorney
sat at another long table to represent the
cause of the State. Tall, urbane, white-haired,
with the reputation of being a pitiless prosecutor of
criminals, Dan Davazec was confident and jaunty.
He fussed about busily, arranging and rearranging
the table in front of him, shoving aside the water-pitcher,
the ink-bottle, a pile of law-books with
freckled-leather covers, as a battleship strips her
decks for action.</p>

<p>“It’s a cinch, Sam,” he chuckled to the editor
of the Tickfall <i>Whoop</i>. “Dead open-and-shut!”</p>

<p>Davazec had tried in vain to find a wife, or
mother, or sisters of the night-watchman for whose
murder Hitch Diamond was to be tried. He
wanted somebody to lend force and eloquence to
his plea by sitting before the jury dressed in black
and wearing a long, thick mourning veil. But
the murdered man apparently had no kinsmen, so
Davazec lacked these eloquent figures of desolation
and sorrow.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span></p>

<p>But the two owners of the Sawtown mill sat at
the table beside Davazec, and the room in the rear
of the judge’s bench was crowded with witnesses.
Davazec felt the importance of his place and the
certain triumph of his cause, and he swelled and
expanded in his clothes at the thought of how
helpful this day’s proceedings would be to him
when he announced himself for reëlection.</p>

<p>From his office in the rear the judge entered the
court-room, followed by a clerk bearing a few law-books
and some sheets of paper and a large palm-leaf
fan. Judge Haddan was a pale, sickly looking
man with a weak voice, trembling hands, and
stooped shoulders. But his head was massive and
Websterian, and his eyes glowed like the eyes of
some jungle beast. No man within the borders
of the State commanded more respect as a lawyer
and a jurist.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond raised his massive head and
eyed the judge with the stolid gaze of a stupid
horse. Goldie gasped, and laced and interlaced
her nervous fingers in her lap.</p>

<p>The opening ceremonies of the court were soon
over. No one paid any attention to the few formalities,
for they were all hastening to get at the
thing of big interest.</p>

<p>The clerk called the case of the Commonwealth
<i>versus</i> Hitch Diamond.</p>

<p>“We are ready, your honor,” Dan Davazec said
in his clear voice.</p>

<p>“Where is your counsel, Hitch Diamond?”
Judge Haddan asked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span></p>

<p>“I ain’t got none, boss,” Hitch answered.</p>

<p>“Do you wish me to assign you counsel?”
Haddan inquired.</p>

<p>Hitch stood up and scratched his woolly head.</p>

<p>“Boss,” he said, in a sad tone, “one time when
yo’ leetle gal got sick an’ you lived out on yo’
plantation in de country, I done you a leetle favor.
Does you remember, boss?”</p>

<p>Haddan looked straight at Hitch Diamond while
his nervous fingers drummed upon the arms of his
chair. He seemed not to have heard what Hitch
had said.</p>

<p>“Do you wish me to assign you counsel?” he
asked again.</p>

<p>“Boss,” Hitch continued, “when yo’ little gal
got sick, de water had done riz up an’ de Dorfoche
Bayou wus seben miles wide&mdash;an’ you axed me to
go atter de dorctor. I waded an’ swum dat bayou&mdash;I
got acrost dat seben mile of water&mdash;I fotch de
dorctor&mdash;an’ yo’ little gal got well. Boss, you tole
me den, dat ef I ever needed any he’p, you would
he’p me at any cost&mdash;an’ boss, befo’ Gawd, now is
yo time!”</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond sat down at the table.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Judge Haddan looked at the
State’s attorney; their eyes met, and Davazec
murmured, “Don’t that nigger beat hell!”</p>

<p>“Do you wish me to assign counsel for you,
Hitch?” Judge Haddan asked for the third
time.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, boss!” Hitch said. “I think you
an’ me had better law dis case togedder!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

<p>“Do you plead guilty or not guilty?” Haddan
asked.</p>

<p>Hitch grinned.</p>

<p>“Ain’t dat jes’ whut we is come to try, boss?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“The defendant pleads not guilty!” Judge
Haddan announced with an amused grimace at
the State’s attorney.</p>

<p>Then the clerk called the name of a talesman.</p>

<p>In an hour the jury was complete. Hitch
Diamond left that work entirely in the hands of
Dan Davazec and Judge Haddan. Whenever the
judge excused a talesman from service, Hitch
smiled, and felt that the judge was certainly
winning the case for him!</p>

<p>Then for two hours the crowded court-room of
people sat in breathless silence, while District
Attorney Davazec drove nail after nail into the
gallows which should hang Hitch Diamond. It
was a savage and pitiless prosecution, not because
of the efforts of Davazec, but because of the force
of the testimony, developing a chain of evidence
without a weak or missing link. The jurors, grim,
silent, attentive, fixed their eyes upon each witness,
and when the witness-chair was empty, they
looked down at the floor.</p>

<p>Not one of them glanced at Hitch Diamond.
Jurymen don’t like to watch a man whom they are
making up their minds to condemn to death.</p>

<p>Hitch listened to the evidence without a word
or question to a single witness. If Judge Haddan
asked a question, Hitch grinned. He seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
never to comprehend the effect of the statements
that were being made.</p>

<p>Dan Davazec arose and announced with dramatic
emphasis:</p>

<p>“Your honor, the State closes!”</p>

<p>The crowd in the court-room drew a long breath;
a humming murmur like a breeze in the tree-tops
swept over the heads of the people.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond arose.</p>

<p>“Boss,” he announced to the judge, “Mister
Danny Davazec is shore done hisse’f proud, an’ all
dem white men is tole de truth&mdash;as fur as dey
knows it. I closes up de State’s case, too!”</p>

<p>A snicker sounded from the rear benches, where
an assortment of white toughs and loafers had congregated
for gratuitous entertainment.</p>

<p>The jury stared at the floor.</p>

<h3>XVI<br />

WITNESS FOR THE DEFENSE.</h3>

<p>“Have you any witnesses, Hitch?” Judge Haddan
inquired, nervously mopping at his temples
with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. I wants to ’terrogate Skeeter Butts,
please, suh.”</p>

<p>There was a slight movement in the crowd in
the rear of the court-room, and Skeeter came forward
and pushed open the little gate in the low
railing, which, like a river levee, held back an overflow
of black people.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>

<p>He had moved slowly through the crowd, proud
of being called as a witness, ostentatiously speaking
to every colored person he knew, and bowing
with fine courtesy to every white face.</p>

<p>Respectably dressed, and extremely respectful
in his manner, Skeeter came to the witness stand
with the air of a man who knew exactly how to act
in the company of white folks.</p>

<p>The jurors straightened up in their seats, looking
at Skeeter with interest, wondering what light he
could bring to brighten the black cloud which hung
over the defendant. Skeeter noted the movement
and bowed.</p>

<p>“Mawnin’, gen’lemens!” he murmured.</p>

<p>At the admonition of the judge, Skeeter held
up his right hand, a clerk rattled off a string of
words which Skeeter could not understand, and
Skeeter dropped his hand.</p>

<p>“Thank ’e, suh!” he said.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time during the trial, Hitch
Diamond came to life.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, picked up the heavy table
against which he had been leaning, and set it
entirely out of his way by placing it so close to the
witness stand that Skeeter Butts could have reached
out his foot from the chair and stepped on it.</p>

<p>A heavy iron cuspidor stood in the middle of the
space which Hitch was clearing for himself, so he
set it out of his way. After that he moved two
heavy chairs.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sheriff John Flournoy woke up!</p>

<p>It looked to him like Hitch Diamond had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
cleared a space for himself clear across the court-room
in front of the judge to the open window
where Pap Curtain, Hitch’s father-in-law, was sitting.
He noticed that Pap Curtain had slipped
off the window ledge and was standing with his
back to the window, one hand stretched out on
either side.</p>

<p>Hitch was getting ready to run!</p>

<p>As quietly as possible, Sheriff Flournoy slipped
across the platform behind the judge’s seat and
stationed himself near the window where Pap
Curtain stood.</p>

<p>Pap smiled and nodded knowingly.</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, Marse John,” he grinned, as he
waved his hand toward Hitch Diamond. “Git
a good ready! Dat Tickfall Tiger is gwine scratch
somebody’s back!”</p>

<p>Having completed his preparations, Hitch Diamond
turned to his star witness.</p>

<p>“Whut am yo’ name, Skeeter Butts?” he
bellowed.</p>

<p>Skeeter got mad and began to swell up.</p>

<p>“You done called me by my name!” he snapped.</p>

<p>“Tell de white folks whut is yo’ name, Skeeter!”
Hitch growled. “Mebbe dey is seed yo’ favor
but disremember de name of yo’ face!”</p>

<p>“Skeeter Butts!” the witness replied grumpily.</p>

<p>“Does you know who kilt dat night-watchman
down at Sawtown?” Hitch asked.</p>

<p>“Suttinly.”</p>

<p>“Was you dar when it happened?” Hitch
inquired.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span></p>

<p>“Naw, suh.”</p>

<p>“Was it me whut done it?” Hitch bellowed.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh,” Skeeter answered positively.</p>

<p>“Who done it?” Hitch Diamond howled.</p>

<p>Skeeter hitched himself forward until he sat
upon the extreme edge of the witness chair. He
hung his brown derby hat upon the first finger
of his left hand and turned it round and round
with the finger and thumb of his right hand. He
stared at the table which Hitch had lifted and
placed before him.</p>

<p>The members of the jury suddenly sat up and
took notice.</p>

<p>They had known negroes all their lives; they had
had negro playmates when they were boys; and
now they “read sign” on Skeeter. They knew
Skeeter was going to explode something. Their
backbones stiffened in their chairs as if the marrow
had suddenly turned to rigid steel.</p>

<p>“Who&mdash;done&mdash;it?” Hitch Diamond bellowed.</p>

<p>Skeeter pushed himself back in his chair. His
little brown derby hat fell from his finger, rattled
and bounced in a ridiculous fashion across the
table before him, fell to the floor and rocked to and
fro on the curved crown.</p>

<p>Skeeter stretched out his hand with two middle
fingers and the thumb flexed, and the first finger
and the little finger extended in such a way that he
pointed at the same time with one gesture to two
men sitting in different parts of the court-room.
Then he answered:</p>

<p>“Dinner Gaze and Tucky Sugg!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span></p>

<p>Judge Haddan slumped forward in his chair, his
delicate, fragile hands gripping the edge of the desk
before him. The district attorney, a man who
generally possessed perfect poise and self-possession,
was jerked to his feet by this announcement
and stood in absolute silence waving his hands to
and fro like an embarrassed schoolboy who had
suddenly forgotten how to “speak his piece.”
The jury sank back in their chairs with a low sigh
of gratification. They had tuned their ears for the
sound of an explosion, and the effect had produced
a pleasant shock.</p>

<p>Silence in the court-room, a silence appalling.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond, who had been standing like a
statue carved from ebony, slowly turned and faced
the crowd of black men sitting behind him.</p>

<p>Then a voice cracked the silence like a starter’s
pistol shot over the backs of two men straining for
a race; it was the voice of Ginny Babe Chew:</p>

<p>“Dar&mdash;now!”</p>

<p>In the twenty seconds which had elapsed since
Skeeter made his astounding statement, Dinner
Gaze and Tucky Sugg had both considered the
chances and the avenues of escape, as well as the
possibility of remaining in their places and protesting
innocence of the charge. Ginny Babe Chew’s
triumphant exclamation decided the issue.</p>

<p>The low railing around the bar was directly
before them. They sprang forward to clear it, and
lo! Vinegar Atts was swinging to Tucky Sugg’s
coat-tail, and Ginny Babe Chew was hanging to
the coat-tail of Dinner Gaze!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span></p>

<p>In an instant each man had slipped his arms
out of his coat and was free. They leaped the railing,
standing in the open space which Hitch
Diamond had so ostentatiously cleared.</p>

<p>Under their coats, the two men carried pistol
holsters, and now they stood with their backs
against the wall beside the judge’s bench, at bay,
each with a pistol in his hand.</p>

<p>There was confusion for about ten seconds
while the court-room cleared of its occupants. It
took just that long for all to get out who wanted
to go. That was sufficient time for some eager
ones to pass the post-office two blocks away!</p>

<p>Suddenly Dinner Gaze’s dangerous, desperate
voice rang out clearly, with an intonation which
pierced like a sword:</p>

<p>“Don’t come dis way, white folks! Ef you do,
you better come a-shootin’ an’ pick out yo’ grave
befo’ you starts!”</p>

<h3>XVII<br />

SMOKE OF BATTLE.</h3>

<p>By terrible and evil ways, the reckless feet of
Dinner Gaze and Tucky Sugg had come to that
cleared space in the Tickfall court-room. In the
next few minutes, they were going to make Tickfall
history.</p>

<p>No man knew this better than the sheriff, the
district attorney, the judge of the district court,
and the jurors, as each man stood in his place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
and planned his part in the coming battle. The
negro is the deadliest fighter on earth&mdash;when he
makes up his mind to fight.</p>

<p>Sheriff Flournoy raised his gun&mdash;and the fight
was on. With a motion as easy and as mechanical
as the gesture of a man flecking a speck of dust
from his cuff, Dinner Gaze turned his hand and
shot back. The two guns spoke simultaneously.</p>

<p>With an oath, Sheriff Flournoy dropped his
useless gun at his feet&mdash;the bullet from Dinner
Gaze’s pistol had struck it and put it permanently
out of business.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond snarled like an angry beast.
By a thrust of his foot, he turned over the table
before which Skeeter Butts sat, making a barrier
for himself. At the same instant of time, he hurled
a heavy chair straight at Dinner Gaze, who stood
grinning, leering at Sheriff Flournoy, who was now
weaponless.</p>

<p>Hitch dropped down behind the table as a bullet
splashed through the wood two inches above him,
and also splashed every juryman out of the box
like a big flat rock falling in a puddle of mud!</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts jerked a pistol from his coat
pocket and tossed it to Hitch Diamond. Lifting
with his powerful left arm, Hitch held up that
heavy table as a shield between him and his
enemies, and crashed forward toward Gaze and
Sugg, shooting as he went. Falling, he shot again;
sprawling upon the floor, he raised himself above
the table and shot still again.</p>

<p>Once more Hitch Diamond charged forward,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
drawing closer to the fighting pair, staggering with
his heavy table as a shield, economical with his
gun-fire, waiting for a chance to kill, blazing, terrible,
alone, moving toward the flash and smoke
and rattle of the two guns barking from the hands
of the two men who stood with their backs against
the wall with leering grins upon their faces.</p>

<p>The unarmed men in the court-room dodged
behind the furniture and crawled under the seats,
shuddering at the fury of battle, as the bullets tore
the plastering from the ceiling and the walls, splintered
the furniture, ricocheted around the room,
smashing windows and the glass globes of the
electric lights.</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell it, Hitch’s last
bullet was fired and he snapped his empty gun into
the faces of his enemies. At nearly the same
moment Dinner Gaze and Tucky Sugg threw aside
their own empty and useless weapons.</p>

<p>With a loud bellow, Hitch Diamond tossed
the table from him, breaking off the two legs on
one side. He sprang around, and in and out,
striking blows which had made him famous in the
pugilistic ring all over the State. He struck and
parried and struck again, pounding, pounding at
the faces of the two shrieking men who fought
at him with weapons mightier than their fists, for
they were fighting with the legs of the table which
Hitch had broken off when he tossed his improvised
shield aside!</p>

<p>There was a rush of help coming to the aid
of Hitch Diamond&mdash;Sheriff Flournoy, the district
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
attorney, the two mill owners, a court-clerk,
twelve jurors, Skeeter Butts, and Vinegar Atts.</p>

<p>Then began a noise of shouting and tumult,
oaths, curses; shrieking, horrible, blood-stained
faces, snarling lips and gnashing teeth, and Hitch
Diamond fought on, leading the hosts who stood
for law and justice. Pain tore at his bruised and
bleeding face, blood streamed from his hands and
arms, his mighty, heaving chest left stains of red
upon his white shirt bosom.</p>

<p>Men fell, and Hitch stepped on them. Hitch
fell, and men stepped on him. All men slipped
and slid in blood, crushed each other, dragged
each other down, struck each other&mdash;and all
heaved and cursed and shouted and hammered
and tore at the shuddering tangle of human flesh
and bone.</p>

<p>Standing on a chair close to the struggling men
was a woman&mdash;a woman of wicked, half-caste
beauty, her long Indian hair streaming down her
back, her golden-colored hands weaving to and fro
with clenched fists, her golden face blazing with
hate and fury&mdash;fit mate for Hitch Diamond, whose
wife she was.</p>

<p>Her voice rang like a trumpet:</p>

<p>“Kill ’em, Hitchie! Kill ’em! Kill ’em! Kill
’em!”</p>

<p>Such a brutal, demoniacal struggle could not
endure long. Vinegar Atts was senseless. Skeeter
Butts lay flat on his back against the wall with
the blood streaming from an ugly cut upon his
head. Three of the jurors nursed broken arms,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
and several more had retired from the fray disabled
by their injuries.</p>

<p>Sheriff Flournoy lay on the floor with the blood
flowing from a wound on his neck. He crawled
over and picked up the pistol which Skeeter Butts
had given to Hitch Diamond and which Hitch had
discarded. He extracted the cartridges from his
own useless pistol and slipped them into Skeeter’s
gun, for he had given that weapon to Skeeter and
they were of the same calibre.</p>

<p>Just at that moment Tucky Sugg fought his
way through the tangle of human arms and legs
and sprang into the open window. Then he went
screaming downward to his death as a bullet from
the sheriff’s pistol went with him, pocketed in the
murderer’s heart!</p>

<p>Then, as if the crack of the sheriff’s pistol was
her cue to enter, another woman came up-stage and
stood in the blazing light of battle. She weighed
four hundred and ten pounds, and resembled
a balloon divided in the middle by an apron string.
She was conducted by Dainty Blackum and a
strange young negro man, and her name was Ginny
Babe Chew.</p>

<p>Inside the railing, she picked up a heavy iron
cuspidor, and walked over to the table where,
earlier in the morning, the district attorney had
sat.</p>

<p>“He’p me up on dis here table, honey!” she
grunted, hugging the heavy cuspidor in her arms.</p>

<p>The district attorney lay unconscious under the
table on which Ginny stood.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span></p>

<p>Ginny announced her position by a loud bellow.
She raised the large iron cuspidor above her head
with her fat arms, and every pound of her monstrous
weight was quivering with unspeakable hate.</p>

<p>“Git outen my way, Hitchie!” she whooped.
“Gimme room accawdin’ to my fat, sonny! Let
yo’ mammy put somepin acrost!”</p>

<p>For more than a minute Sheriff Flournoy had
been fingering his pistol, waiting for a chance
to shoot without killing Hitch Diamond. Ginny
Babe Chew’s remarkable stunt gave him pause and
caused him to lower his gun with astonishment.</p>

<p>Hitch reeled and stumbled backward. His eyes
were glazing, his right arm hung broken and useless
at his side, he was one bloody mass of wounds.</p>

<p>Dinner Gaze, his clothes torn from him until he
was bare to the waist, his whole body screaming
with pain from countless injuries, slowly followed
Hitch in his retreat, chopping at him with weakening
arms, still fighting with the broken table-leg.</p>

<p>“Look up, Dinner Gaze!” Ginny Babe Chew
bawled. “Dis is yo’ la-ast time to see de hoodoo
face!”</p>

<p>Unconsciously responding to the command, Dinner
Gaze raised his pain-shot eyes upward, and
looked into the fat face, through whose rolls of
flesh two green pig eyes gleamed upon him with a
serpent’s venom and deadly malignity.</p>

<p>The heavy iron cuspidor came down with a
crash. It crushed the criminal’s head like an egg-shell.
It bounced, fell on its rounded edge, and
rolled slowly across the floor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span></p>

<p>Dinner Gaze fell face downward, kicked the floor
three times with the toes of his shoes, and died.</p>

<p>“Dar&mdash;<i>now</i>!” Ginny Babe Chew whooped.</p>

<p>Then she held out a fat hand to the slim young
girl standing beside the table and said:</p>

<p>“Gimme yo’ hand an’ he’p me down offen dis
table, honey! Dis here duck is too dang fat to be
roostin’ so high!”</p>

<h3>XVIII<br />

THE HOODOO FACE SMILES.</h3>

<p>The panic and outflow of negroes from the trial
chamber in the Tickfall courthouse started a riot-call
in the town.</p>

<p>A clerk in the Gaitskill store across the street
ran over and tolled the courthouse bell ten times.
In response, every white man in Tickfall dropped
his task, armed himself, and came with all possible
haste to the court square.</p>

<p>When Tucky Sugg fell screaming from the open
window, Colonel Tom Gaitskill started at the head
of a band of armed men up the steps leading to
the court-room. The band arrived too late to do
more than constitute themselves into an ambulance
corps, and render first aid to the injured.</p>

<p>Four physicians came panting up the steps,
bumping their instrument cases against the wall
as they ran, and their arrival converted the room
into a hospital where the doctor became a wise
and efficient judge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span></p>

<p>Colonel Gaitskill appointed ten men as assistants
and runners for the doctors, assigned to the rest
of his band the task of standing on the square in
heroic attitudes and guarding the courthouse, and
then he cleared the room of all the curious and useless
persons and closed the door.</p>

<p>An hour later all the wounded sat up and took
notice, and some of them smiled.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts arose from his place, sobbing with
pain. He staggered across the blood-splashed
floor toward a pitcher of water which sat on the
floor by the judge’s bench. Weakness overcame
him, and he sank down in the witness-chair, almost
fainting.</p>

<p>Judge Henry Haddan, whose Websterian head
was considerably larger now on account of certain
bruised and swollen places, and a big wad of cotton
applied to them, thrust a glass of water into
Skeeter’s trembling hands.</p>

<p>“Skeeter,” he asked, “how did you know that
Dinner Gaze and Tucky Sugg committed that
crime in Sawtown?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know, Marse Henry,” Skeeter answered
in a weak voice. “I sot down in dis chair
an’ I said jes’ whut Ginny Babe Chew tole me to
say!”</p>

<p>Everybody in the court-room heard Skeeter’s
answer. There was a general gasp of astonishment.</p>

<p>Judge Haddan walked wearily up to his bench
and sat down. It appeared later that he was
seriously hurt, and he spent many weeks in bed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
But now he was sustained by the excitement of the
moment.</p>

<p>The district attorney dragged himself across the
floor and sat down at his table near to where Dinner
Gaze lay face downward, his hand still grasping
the table-leg.</p>

<p>Ginny Babe Chew walked to the middle of the
room, rested a fat hand on each fat hip, and looked
up into the face of Judge Haddan.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, boss,” she said. “Ginny Babe
Chew is to blame fer dis here noble fracas!” Then
she smiled.</p>

<p>“How did you know, Ginny?” Judge Haddan
asked, twisting his pain-shot face into an answering
smile, and feeling of an extremely sore place on
top of his head.</p>

<p>“Dude Blackum tole me!” she answered.</p>

<p>“Dude Blackum is dead&mdash;drowned in attempting
to escape!” Judge Haddan snapped.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh. He warn’t drowned. He’s a settin’
right dar by Dainty Blackum now!”</p>

<p>As she pointed a young, respectful, nicely
dressed negro stood up, bowed to the judge, and
smiled, flashing a gold front tooth.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, jedge,” he murmured in a deprecatory
tone. “I ain’t dead!”</p>

<p>Then they listened while Dude told his story.</p>

<p>After leaving his cabin with the jug, he had
taken several drinks and had crawled under the
porch of the commissary store to sleep because he
was afraid to go back home to listen to what Dainty
was sure to say about his conduct. He had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
awakened by having something thrown over his
face&mdash;and this afterward proved to be the coat and
vest which Tucky Sugg had taken from Hitch Diamond.
Dude heard two men talking, heard them
call each other by name, heard them enter the
store for robbery; then Dude had seized his jug
and had run to the night-watchman and made a
report.</p>

<p>The night-watchman, running to the store, had
been killed.</p>

<p>Dude, dodging among the lumber piles, had
been captured; the only man who could clear him
of suspicion had just been killed; his captors would
not listen to explanations, so Dude took a desperate
chance by jumping into the river, and had
escaped.</p>

<p>What the mob thought was Dude’s woolly
head bobbing upon the surface of the water was
really Dude’s derby hat. Expecting them to
shoot at his hat, Dude waited until the right time,
and artfully contributed a splash and a scream,
and the mob thought he had got cramps and
sunk.</p>

<p>Chucklingly, Dude told his auditors that he was
beating his hat down the river about thirty yards,
swimming like Jonah inside the whale.</p>

<p>He returned to his cabin that night, explained
everything to Dainty, mounted a mustang, and
rode to Ginny Babe Chew’s cabin, where she
concealed him until the time of the trial. Skeeter
had seen his face at the dormer window when the
chicken-house burned down.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span></p>

<p>“I knowed dat Dinner Gaze an’ Tucky Sugg
done it, Marse Henry,” Skeeter cackled. “I
knowed it all de time&mdash;I had a hunch!”</p>

<p>“I knowed it, too,” Ginny Babe Chew rumbled.
“I’s got a hoodoo face.”</p>

<p>“I knowed it,” Hitch Diamond growled.
“Goldie told me.”</p>

<p>“I think we had better go home,” Judge Henry
Haddan said, with a funny twisted smile. “My
head hurts!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, your honor,” the district
attorney said, rising painfully to his feet and
leaning weakly against the table. “Excuse me&mdash;but
haven’t you forgotten something?”</p>

<p>Judge Haddan’s aching head was not working
clearly, and he did not catch Davazec’s meaning at
all. He thought he understood, and so he announced:</p>

<p>“Hitch Diamond, you are a brave negro. Your
heroic fight in this court-room will be long remembered.”
Haddan broke off, tried to smile, and
continued: “Your masterly presentation of your
defense disproves, in this instance, the aphorism
that a lawyer who pleads his own case has a fool for
a client.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, boss!” Ginny Babe Chew whooped.
“Little Hitchie shore is brave an’ smart, ef I do
say it myse’f, whut hadn’t oughter. Nobody in
dis country don’t know it but me and Hitch&mdash;but
I is Hitch’s mammy! He is kin to me by bornation
on de Flournoy plantation fawty years
ago&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span></p>

<p>“Aw, hush!” Judge Haddan exclaimed. “I am
feeling very badly, and I am going home&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, your honor!” the district
attorney repeated in a courteous but insistent tone.
“Have you not forgotten something?”</p>

<p>Judge Haddan rested both hands upon his aching
head and thought. Then he forgot his aching
head and laughed. He straightened up and
spoke:</p>

<p>“The indictments against defendant are dismissed,
and defendant discharged&mdash;the jury is
excused, and court adjourned! Hitch Diamond,
you are free!”</p>

<p>“Dar now, boss,” Hitch bellowed, grinning into
his honor’s face. “I wus plum’ shore you an’ me
could win dis case ef we jes’ sot our minds to do
it. Bless Gawd!”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
